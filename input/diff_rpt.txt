comment1:   Nucleotide substitution 1171 base pairs upstream of the ATG translational start site in the PTEN core promoter region; Also called c.-1170C&gt;G using alternate
            numbering, has been reported as a mutation in two patients who met relaxed International Cowden Consortium operational criteria for CS (Tan 2011); occurs within
            a region of the PTEN promoter (c.-798 to c.-1238) in which published pathogenic promoter mutations are located and Zhou et al. (2003) reported that
            approximately 9% (9/95) of patients with Cowden syndrome were found to carry a point mutation in the PTEN core promoter region. The variant is found in
            HEREDICANCER,HIRISK-BR-HEREDIC panel(s).

comment1:   Conservative substitution altering a position that is well conserved throughout evolution and is located in within the E-Cad/CTF1 chain in the cytoplasmic
            topological domain; In silico analyses are inconsistent; Reported as a pathogenic mutation in two families with diffuse gastric cancer, one of which also
            included a family history of breast cancer (Kaurah 2007, Benusiglio 2013); Multiple functional studies have demonstrated that this mutation causes impaired
            epithelial cadherin function, reduced E-cadherin expression, and a significantly decreased number of interactions with E-cadherin binding partners (Kaurah 2007,
            Figueiredo 2013). The variant is found in HIRISK-BR-HEREDIC panel(s).

comment2:   Non-conservative amino acid substitution at a position that is moderately conserved across species and is located in the known functional B-domain (Weirich
            2002); In silico analyses predict that this variant is unlikely to alter protein structure or function; Reported in several individuals and families with Von
            Hippel Lindau-related cancers (Zbar 1996, GlÌ_sker 1999, Hes 2000, Weirich 2002, Erlic 2010); Identified in families who also carried a likely deleterious VHL
            mutation in cis (Weirich 2002, Erlic 2010); identified in a family with a large deletion of the entire VHL gene in trans, in whom this variant did not segregate
            with disease (Erlic 2010); Hes et al. (2000) identified this mutation in a proband with hemangioblastoma with no affected family members, including some at
            older ages who carried the variant; some authors suggest that this variant might be a low penetrance allele or a modifier; some functional studies suggest
            normal activity (Knauth 2009), others suggest this variant it may lead to lack of ubiquitination, reduced damage response, and resistance to ionizing radiation-
            induced apoptosis (Li 2002, Desimone 2013). The variant is found in HEREDICANCER panel(s).

comment2:   Non-conservative substitution altering a position that is moderately conserved throughout evolution and is located in extracellular Cadherin 2 domain; In silico
            analyses predict this variant to have a benign effect; Reported in association with Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer as defined by the International Gastric
            Cancer Linkage Consortium (Oliveira 2002). Functional studies have demonstrated that the CDH1 Thr340Ala affects protein function (Suriano 2003, Mateus 2009);
            Other studies have suggested that this variant may have a more mild functional effect compared to other CDH1 mutations (Kim 2000, Figueiredo 2013) The variant
            is found in HEREDICANCER panel(s).

comment2:   Conservative change in a semi-conserved amino acid, LIKELY to create a cryptic splice donor site in exon 15; Several splice site prediction programs concur that
            c.4868C&gt;G creates a new splice donor site; In silico analysis deletrious (Walker 2010); Reported 30:1 odds in favor causality based on personal and family
            history of cancer, co-occurrence, and co-segregation data (Easton 2007)

comment2:   Conservative substitution at a position that is moderately conserved throughout evolution; Reported in the literature both as a germline and somatic mutation
            but the clinical significance as it relates to PJS is not known; First described as a germline mutation by Amos et al (2004) in a family of UNCERTAIN size, in
            which it was reported to cosegregate with a PJS phenotype; Also observed in a French-Canadian patient with breast cancer but did not segregate with the disease
            in the family and the change seen in one control patient from this study (Guenard 2010); Additionally observed as an inherited variant in a patient referred to
            GeneDx who also had a de novo splice site mutation in the STK11 gene; Functional studies have shown that it does not impair protein kinase activity nor
            interfere with the translocation of STK11 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, as do the vast majority of PJS-causing mutations (Launonen 2000; Forcet 2005);
            Additional studies have shown that this variant decreases AMPK activity and impacts cell polarity; however, it is not clear how, or if, these changes result in
            PJS (Forcet 2005); Observed with 4.7% minor allele frequency in individuals of Asian descent (1000 Genomes Browser Database) and with 0.4% minor allele
            frequency in individuals of European and African American backgrounds (NHLBI ESP Exome Variant Server). The variant is found in
            BR-OV-HEREDIC,COLO-HEREDIC,HEREDICANCER,HIRISK-BR-HEREDIC panel(s).

comment2:   Semi-conservative substitution of a neutral polar amino acid for a neutral non-polar one at a position that is well conserved throughout evolution and is
            located in the ATPase domain (Fukui 2011); Multiple in silico algorithms predict that this variant may be damaging to protein structure and function; Reported
            in many individuals with Lynch syndrome tumors, and was hypothesized to be a founder mutation among Caucasians (Senter 2008, Tomsic 2013); Observed in
            individuals with the recessive condition Congenital Mismatch Repair Deficiency syndrome (CMMR-D) who also carried a second PMS2 mutation on the opposite
            chromosome (Clendenning 2006, Hekert 2011); While some in vitro studies have been inconclusive, a subset showed reduced PMS2 expression as well as a reduction
            of mismatch repair proficiency (Nakagawa 2004, Borras 2013); Multiple tumors from carriers of this variant exhibited microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and
            immunohistochemistry consistent with loss of PMS2 expression (Nakagawa 2004, Clendenning 2006, Senter 2008). The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s).

comment2:   Non-conservative substitution altering a position that is well conserved throughout evolution and is located in the Forkhead-associated domain; In silico
            analyses are inconsistent; Observed with approximate population frequencies of 0.4% in European Americans in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server and 1.4% in 1000
            Genomes but is more common in Finland and Poland with population frequencies of 5.3% and 4.8% respectively (Desrichard 2011); Case control studies have revealed
            this variant to be significantly associated with breast cancer (OR= approximately 1.5 for both sporadic and familial cases) (Desrichard 2011, Liu 2012, Han
            2013); A large meta-analysis suggested a stronger association of this variant with lobular breast cancer compared to controls (OR&gt;4.1) (Liu 2012); Observed
            at a higher frequency in colon cancer cases (OR= 1.4-1.7 sporadic or unselected, and OR=2.0-2.1 familial) (Kilpivaara 2006, Suchy 2010, Han 2013); Associated
            with familial prostate cancer (OR=2.1-3.8) (Seppala 2003, Cybulski 2004); An earlier study observed an increased risk for non-familial prostate cancer but a
            large meta-analysis did not confirm this association (Cybulski 2004, Han 2013); Demonstrates impairment, with loss of activity with respect to CHEK2-mediated
            DNA damage response, inability to appropriately bind to checkpoint proteins including p53, and inability to autophosphorylate (Falck 2001, Schwarz 2003, Roeb
            2012); Pedigrees of at least two large families displayed incomplete segregation of this variant with breast cancer (Roeb 2012); May represent a mutational
            hotspot since multiple distinct haplotype backgrounds exist (Kaufman 2009) The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,ENDOM-HEREDIC,HEREDICANCER panel(s).

comment2:   This sequence change has been reported in patients affected with breast and ovarian cancer (PMID: 22451500, 22538716) and has not been reported as a common
            polymorphism in the population. This sequence change affects a highly conserved amino acid. The functional activity of this Gln143Arg change is reportedly
            reduced relative to wild-type (PMID: 22451500). However, the clinical importance of this experimental result has not been established. This sequence change is
            potentially pathogenic, although at this time the evidence is insufficient to prove that conclusively. This result should be interpreted within the context of
            clinical findings, family history and additional laboratory data.

comment2:   Val392Ile in exon 9 of DSG2: This variant has been reported in many individuals with diverse presentations (ARVC, LQTS1, LDAC, DCM: Syrris 2007, Bhuiyan 2009,
            Bauce 2010, Klauke 2010, Quarta 2011, Cox 2011, Bauce 2011, Garcia-Parva 2011, LMM unpublished data). However, this variant has also been identified in 0.2%
            (17/8220) of European American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs193922639).
            In addition, Valine (Val) at position 392 is poorly conserved in evolution and the variant is present in two species (including 1 mammal), suggesting that a
            change to this position may be tolerated. Of note, this variant commonly occurs together with the DSC2 Leu732Val variant (also likely benign) suggesting that
            these variants are present on the same allele (the DSG2 and DSC2 genes are located in close proximity on chromosome 18q12). In summary, this variant is likely
            benign but additional studies are needed to fully assess its clinical significance. A modifying role cannot be excluded at this point.

comment2:   The 2146-1G&gt;C variant in PKP2 has been reported in over 20 individuals with ARVC and was absent from 2100 control chromosomes across multiple studies (Gerull
            2004, Syrris 2006, Dalal 2006, Wlodarska 2008, Watkins 2009, den Haan 2009, Asimaki 2009, La Gerche 2010, Fressart 2010, Borahona-Dussault 2010, Cox 2011; see
            http://arvcdatabase.info for more information on these studies). This variant has been identified in 2/8600 European American chromosomes from a broad
            population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS). Please note that for diseases with clinical variability, reduced
            penetrance, or recessive inheritance, pathogenic variants may be present at a low frequency in the general population. This variant has been shown to cause
            skipping of exon 11, resulting in a frameshift (Pro716fs) and premature termination 32 amino acids downstream, ultimately leading to a marked reduction of PKP2
            protein in the myocardium (Gerull 2004, Asimaki 2009). In summary, the 2146-1G&gt;C variant is highly likely to be pathogenic, though additional studies are
            required to fully establish its clinical significance.

comment2:   The Thr400Asn variant in PRKAG2 has been reported in 1 individual with LVH and WPW syndrome (Arad 2002). An endomyocardial biopsy showed vacuolization and
            myocyte disarray was absent, which is consistent with storage cardiomyopathy caused by PRKAG2 variants (Arad 2002). This variant has been identified in 1
            Caucasian individual with HCM and WPW tested by our laboratory (this individual's daughter) and was not identified in large and broad European American and
            African American populations by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/). The low frequency of this variant, along with functional
            studies in yeast and mice (Arad 2002, Banerjee 2009, Scott 2004), and computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD,
            PolyPhen2, and SIFT) all support a pathogenic role. In addition, this variant is located within the CBS domain region (amino acids 274-556) where all pathogenic
            PRKAG2 variants have been identified to date (Oliveira 2003). In summary, this variant is likely to be pathogenic.

comment2:   Pro608Arg in exon 18 of USH1C: This variant has been previously reported in two probands; one with hearing loss in conjunction with another homozygous
            truncating variant in MYO7A (Cremers 2007) and as a homozygous variant in the other (Ouyang 2002). This variant was absent from 220 Asian control chromosomes
            and 180 Caucasian control chromosomes (Ouyang 2002) but it is listed in dbSNP (rs41282932 - no frequency data). In summary, the presence of this variant in two
            individuals with another etiology for hearing loss and its presence in dbSNP suggests it is most likely benign.

comment2:   The Leu44Pro variant in CSRP3 has been identified in 1 individual with HCM, was absent from 1000 control chromosomes and segregated with disease in 2
            definitively and 1 possibly affected relatives as well as one obligate carrier with unknown disease status (Geier 2003; Geier 2008). This variant was absent
            from two large and broad European and African American populations screened by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP
            rs104894205). The affected amino acid is highly conserved in evolution, suggesting that a change would impact the protein. Other computational analyses
            (biochemical amino acid properties, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) also suggest that the Leu44Pro variant may impact the protein, though this information is
            not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, this data supports that the Leu44Pro variant may be pathogenic but is insufficient to establish
            this with certainty.

comment2:   The 821+5G&gt;A variant in MYBPC3 has been reported in 2 individuals with HCM and was absent from 200 ethnically matched control alleles (Carrier 1997, Richard
            2003). Our laboratory has detected this variant in 2 Caucasian HCM probands (including this individual) out of &gt;2200 Caucasian tested probands. This variant
            is located in the 5' splice region and computational tools predict an impact to splicing. In vitro studies have confirmed aberrant splicing and showed that this
            results in the generation of a truncated MYBPC3 protein (Carrier 1997, Flavigny 1999, Flavigny 2003). In summary, the severe impact to the protein suggests that
            this variant is likely pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.

comment2:   The Glu497Asp variant in MYH7 has been reported in one individual with apical HCM, was absent from 200 control chromosomes, and segregated with disease in one
            affected family member with concentric HCM (Arad 2005). This variant has been identified by our laboratory in 5 HCM probands and segregated with disease in one
            affected relative. In addition, this variant has not been identified in large and broad populations by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project
            (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS); this low frequency in the general population supports a pathogenic role. Glutamic acid (Glu) at position 497 is highly
            conserved across evolutionarily distant species and the change to Aspartic acid (Asp) was predicted to be pathogenic using a computational tool, which was
            validated by our laboratory using a set of cardiomyopathy variants with well-established clinical significance. This tool's pathogenic prediction is estimated
            to be correct 94% of the time (Jordan 2011). In summary, this variant is likely to be pathogenic, though additional segregation studies and functional analyses
            are required to fully establish the pathogenicity of this variant.

comment2:   The Ala1004Ser variant in TTN has been reported in 6 individuals, 4 with DCM, 1 case of SIDS, and 1 child with an ASD who had 1 affected sibling and 3
            unaffected siblings that also carried this variant (Carniel 2005, Hershberger 2010, Posch 2011, Brion 2012). This variant has been identified in 0.1% (11/8600)
            of European American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs143978652). Alanine
            (Ala) at position 1004 is highly conserved in mammals and evolutionarily distant species with the exception of zebrafish, which carries a serine (Ser; this
            variant), raising the possibility that this change may be tolerated. Additional computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2,
            and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, although this variant has been identified in individuals with heart
            disease, its presence in individuals with different diseases, its frequency in the general population, and its presence in another animal suggest that this
            variant is more likely benign. However, we cannot rule out a modifying role. Additional information is needed to fully assess the clinical significance of this
            variant.

comment2:   The Arg154His variant has been reported in a ?young boy? with mid-cavity hypertrophy (an uncommon phenotype of HCM). The variant was absent from 378 control
            chromosomes, supporting a pathogenic role (Poetter 1996). In addition, arginine (Arg) at position 154 is conserved in evolutionary distant species, suggesting
            that a change may not be tolerated. Finally, this individual?s racial background is reported to be Caucasian and our laboratory has not previously identified
            the Arg154His variant in over 1500 Caucasian probands. However, we have identified it in one out of 141 Asian HCM probands as well as the unaffected father (55
            y). We have not yet tested a sufficient number of Asian probands or Asian controls to rule out that this variant is common in this population. In summary,
            evolutionary conservation supports a pathogenic role but control studies or family studies are necessary to help determine the significance of this variant.

comment2:   The Glu143Lys variant in MYL3 has been reported to occur homozygously in 2 RCM probands and one affected relative from Central America, and was absent from 690
            control chromosomes (Olson 2002, Caleshu 2011). Six unaffected family members (including one obligate carrier) were heterozygous for this variant, suggesting an
            autosomal recessive inheritance (Olson 2002, Caleshu 2011). In addition, the Glu143Lys variant has been identified in 3 out of 69 Hispanic probands tested by
            out laboratory. However, there is limited control information for the MYL3 gene for the Hispanic population, and we cannot rule out that this variant is part of
            the spectrum of benign variation in this population. Finally, computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and
            SIFT) suggest that the Glu143Lys variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary,
            additional information is needed to fully assess the clinical significance of the Glu143Lys variant.

            two broad populations (dbSNP rs121434525 and NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project - http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS, respectively). This variant has been reported in
            the literature in 1 proband who died at 7 years of age with DCM and another proband with HCM who carried a second variant in MYBPC3, and was absent in at least
            600 control chromosomes (Mohaptra 2003, Bos 2006). It has also been identified by our laboratory in 1 proband with HCM, 1 proband with DCM and two unaffected
            family members. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Gln9Arg variant may
            not impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to rule out pathogenicity. In summary, additional information is needed to fully assess

comment2:   The His90Tyr variant has been previously reported in one individual with idiopathic early onset HCM and was absent in 180 ethnically matched individuals (360
            chromosomes) as well as 1000 unaffected individuals (Morita 2008). Histidine (His) at position 90 is highly conserved across several evolutionary distant
            species and computational analyses (PolyPhen2, SIFT, AlignGVGD) suggest the His90Tyr variant may impact the protein, increasing the likelihood that the change
            is pathogenic. However, in the absence of additional supporting data, the clinical significance of this variant cannot be determined at this time.

comment2:   The Ser573Leu variant in LMNA has been identified in one individual with infantile left ventricular dilation, who also carried a likely pathogenic frameshift
            TTN variant and three additional variants of unknown significance (LMM unpublished data). This variant has been reported in the literature as heterozygous in 3
            individuals with DCM (Taylor 2003, Pasotti 2008), 1 individual with LGMD (Benedetti 2007), 1 individual with familial partial lipodystrophy (Lanktree 2007), and
            as homozygous in 1 individual with arthropathy, tendinous calcinosis, and progeroid features (Van Esch 2006). It segregated with disease in one affected family
            member with DCM, and was not detected in more than 1000 control chromosomes (Taylor 2003, Lanktree 2007, Pasotti 2008). It has also been listed in dbSNP as a
            probable pathogenic variant (rs60890628). Serine (Ser) at position 573 is not conserved in mammals (elephant has a threonine, Thr), suggesting a change may be
            tolerated. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or against
            an impact to the protein. In summary, although the presence in affected individuals and absence in controls suggests that this variant may play a role in
            disease, it remains unclear if one variant could result in such a wide spectrum of phenotypes. Additional studies are needed to fully assess the clinical
            significance of the Ser573Leu variant.

comment2:   The Pro873His variant in MYBPC3 has been identified in 2 individuals with HCM; the first individual was homozygous for this variant without a family history of
            disease, and while the second carried another MYBPC3 variant of unknown significance and had a family history of HCM (Nanni 2003, Ingles 2005). This variant has
            also been identified in 1/8348 European American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS).
            Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Pro873His variant may impact the

comment2:   The Arg123X variant in BAG3 has been reported in 1 Caucasian individual with DCM and segregated with disease in 3 affected relatives in a dominant fashion
            (Norton 2011). This variant has not been identified in large and broad European American and African American populations screened by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing
            Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/) and this low frequency supports a pathogenic role. This variant creates a premature termination codon at position
            123, which is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein (loss-of-function). Loss-of-function of the BAG3 protein resulted in heart failure in a
            zebrafish model, further supporting pathogenicity of the Arg123X variant. Variants in BAG3 are associated with DCM (Arimura 2011, Norton 2011, Villard 2011) and
            myofibrillar myopathy (Selcen 2009, Lee 2011). In summary, this variant is likely to be pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish
            its clinical significance.

comment2:   The Met163Val variant in GJB2 has been identified in 11 probands with non-syndromic hearing loss, and identified 1/700 control samples (Bayazit 2003, Tang 2006,
            Chaleshtori 2002, Chaleshtori 2005, Dalamón 2005, Günther 2003, Janecke 2002, Marlin 2001). However, in none of the probands was a known pathogenic variant
            found on the second allele of GJB2. In addition, one of the 9 families demonstrated late-onset autosomal dominant inheritance, which is inconsistent with the
            autosomal recessive mode of inheritance in all other probands. In summary, the absence of second variants in all published probands and the presence of the
            variant in an autosomal dominant family suggests that this variant is more likely to be benign.

            this variant induces the skipping of exon 51 leading to the in-frame deletion of 22 amino acids (Liu 1997). Therefore, this variant is likely to be pathogenic.

comment2:   The Arg49His variant in DSG2 has been reported in at least 8 individuals with clinical features or a diagnosis of ARVC, including one de novo occurrence, and
            was absent from 820 control chromosomes (Awad 2006, den Haan 2009, Gandjbakch 2009, Xu 2010, Barahona-Dussault 2010, Fressart 2010). The Arg49His variant has
            not been identified in large and broad European American and African American populations by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project
            (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs121913006) and this low frequency supports a pathogenic role. A presence in other populations cannot be excluded.
            Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or against an impact
            to the protein. In summary, the available evidence for this variant suggests that it is disease-causing, but additional information is still needed to establish
            this with confidence.

comment2:   The 1880-2A&gt;G variant has been reported in two siblings with ARVC and was absent from 560 matched control chromosomes, supporting a pathogenic role. However,
            both siblings also carried a second, possibly disease causing variant on the other copy of the DSG2 gene (Pilichou, 2006). RNA studies demonstrated that the
            1880-2A&gt;G abolishes the splice site, leading to the use of a cryptic splice site 38 bp downstream. The aberrantly spliced mRNA was shown to lack the first 38
            bp of exon 13, which is predicted to cause a frameshift starting at position 627 and premature termination 19 amino acids later, leading to a truncated or
            absent protein (Pilichou, 2006). In summary, the severity of the change as well as absence from controls suggest that this variant is likely pathogenic.

comment2:   Val56Met in exon 3 of DSG2: This variant has been reported in at least 4 individuals with ARVC and was initially believed to be pathogenic (Syrris 2007, Bhuiyan
            2009, Den Haan 2009, Christensen 2010, Quarta 2011). However, it has been identified in 0.35% (29/8222) European American chromosomes from a broad population
            screened by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs121913013), strongly arguing against a disease causing role when
            present in isolation. There is some evidence that the Val56Met variant may predispose to dilated cardiomyopathy as Posch 2008 detected it in 13/538 DCM probands
            versus 3/617 control individuals (p&lt;0.007), but this study has not been replicated nor firmly established. In summary, the Val56Met variant unlikely disease
            causing in isolation, but its increased frequency in patients with DCM versus healthy controls raises the possibility that it acts as a modifier when present
            together with other variants.

comment2:   The Asp196Asn variant in TNNI3 has been reported in 4 individual with HCM, was absent from over 650 control chromosomes, and segregated with disease in 2
            affected relatives from 1 family (Niimura 2002, Richard 2003, Mogensen 2004). This variant has also been identified in 1/6726 European American chromosomes from
            a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs104894727), but we cannot rule out that the individual may
            have been presymptomatic. This variant has been seen in 2 individuals with HCM tested by our laboratory, both of whom carried other variants of unknown clinical
            significance. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or
            against an impact to the protein. Although the presence in affected individuals, absence from controls, and segregation all support that the Asp196Asn variant
            may be pathogenic, additional studies are needed to fully assess its clinical significance.

comment2:   The Ala8Val variant (TNNC1) has been reported in one individual with HCM and was absent from 1000 control chromosomes (Landstorm 2008). In addition, in vitro
            functional studies have shown altered calcium sensitivity of muscle cells, consistent with effects that have been established for other HCM variants (Landstrom
            2008, Pinto 2009, Swindle 2010, Pinto 2011). However, it remains unclear whether these effects would result in disease. Computational analyses (biochemical
            amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that this variant may not impact the protein, though this information is not
            predictive enough to rule out pathogenicity. Of note, the variant affects a position in the exon that is part of the splice consensus sequence and may therefore
            impact splicing. In summary, additional information is needed to fully assess the clinical significance of the Ala8Val variant.

comment2:   The Gly584Arg variant in MYH7 has been reported in 3 Portuguese individuals with HCM (Watkins 1992, Watkins 1993, Santos 2012), has been identified in &gt;20
            individuals with HCM tested by our laboratory, and segregated with disease in 5 affected individuals (including 1 obligate carrier) across 3 families (Watkins
            1993 and LMM unpublished data). This variant was absent from large European American and African American populations by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project
            (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS), which is consistent with a disease-causing role though it could be common in other populations. Glycine (Gly) at position
            584 is highly conserved in evolution, a different, likely pathogenic change at the same position has been detected in an individual with HCM and the change to
            Arginine (Arg) was predicted to be pathogenic using a computational tool, which was clinically validated by our laboratory. This tool's pathogenic prediction is
            estimated to be correct 94% of the time (Jordan 2011). In summary, this variant is very likely to be pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully
            establish its clinical significance.

comment2:   The Arg278Cys variant in TNNT2 has been reported in &gt;10 individuals with HCM and segregated with disease in at least 5 affected individuals (including one
            affected obligate carrier) from multiple families (see references below*). This variant has been reported in 17 individuals with cardiomyopathy (14 Caucasian)
            tested by our laboratory though 7 of these carried a second likely pathogenic or pathogenic variant in another gene. The affected amino acid is not completely
            conserved in evolution and 1 species (elephant) carries a cysteine; however, in vitro studies showed an effect on muscle contraction (see references below**)
            and the variant was predicted to be pathogenic using a clinically validated computational tool (estimated accuracy of pathogenic predictions: 94%, Jordan 2011).
            This variant has been detected in 14/4850 chromosomes from a population of Caucasian individuals with cardiomyopathy tested by our laboratory but only 5/8598
            European American chromosomes from a broad population sequenced by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs121964857).
            The elevated variant frequency in individuals with cardiomyopathy is statistically significant (p=0.0015). This data supports a pathogenic role but suggests a
            mild effect, which is also supported by the fact that many affected individuals carrying the Arg278Cys variants presented at age 50 or older (LMM unpublished
            data). In summary, this variant probably has a milder effect when present in isolation and should be interpreted carefully in the context of the individual?s
            age at onset.

comment2:   The m.1095T&gt;C variant (MTRNR1) has been reported in 17/2717 (0.6%) probands with sensorineural hearing loss with or without aminoglycoside exposure, and was
            only identified in 2/3090 (0.06%) control chromosomes tested (Thyagaragan 2000, Tessa 2001, Zhao 2004, Li 2005, Bae 2008, Dai 2008, Lu 2010, Ealy 2011). In one
            Italian family with Parkinsonism, deafness and neuropathy, the variant segregated with hearing loss in at least two additional maternally related family members
            (Thyagaragan 2000). In another family the variant segregated with nonsyndromic hearing loss in 4 family members (Tessa 2001), though alternate dominant
            inheritance cannot be ruled out. One Chinese proband affected with auditory neuropathy was identified to carry this variant (Wang 2005) as well as 10 other
            Chinese probands with hearing loss (Lu 2010). Functional studies by respiratory chain enzyme analysis in cultured lymphocytes from a proband revealed a
            significant reduction in cytochrome C oxidase activity and the secondary structure predicts that this mutation disrupts a highly conserved loop in the small
            subunit ribosomal RNA, which is important in the initiation of mitochondrial protein synthesis (Thyagarajan 2000). However, this variant has now been found in
            higher frequency, ~1%, in several control populations of Asian background (1/124, 4/921, 1/96, 1/112) (see LOVD database http://www.lovd.nl/2.0; mtDB
            http://www.mtdb.igp.uu.se; HmtDB http://www.hmtdb.uniba.it:8080/hmdb). And one study asserts that this variant represents a sub-haplotype of an East-Asian
            population and is not disease causing (Yao 2006). In summary, there is conflicting data regarding the pathogenicity of the 1095T&gt;C variant. The variability
            of phenotypes described and the presence of the variant at 1% frequency in Asian control populations suggests that the variant is more likely benign; however,
            more data is needed to confirm this assumption.

            2004, LMM unpublished data). However, subsequent studies have identified this variant as common in the general population with similar frequencies among hearing
            loss patients and controls (0.2% ? 3%) (Bardien 2009, Elstner 2008, Konings 2008, Rydzanicz 2010, 6 observations in the LOVD database http://www.lovd.nl/2.0;

            the mitochondrial translation products with the m.961T&gt;G mutation compared to controls (Elstner 2008). Moreover, this region of mitochondrial DNA is not
            evolutionarily conserved and its function is not well defined. Of note, chicken has guanine at position m.961 (Konings 2008). One study of cystic fibrosis adult
            patients did not observe a correlation between this variant and aminoglycoside ototoxicity (Conrad 2008). In summary, the clinical significance of this variant
            cannot be determined with certainty at this time.

comment2:   Thr2205Ile variant in exon 31 of MYO15A: This variant is not expected to have clinical significance because it has been identified in has been reported in 0.4%
            (33/8348) of European American chromosomes chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP
            rs121908970). It has been reported in the hemizygous state in an individual with Smith-Lemli-Opitz sydnrome (Liburd 2001) and homozygous in one individual with
            hearing loss who also carries a homozygous nonsense variant in MYO15A (Nal 2007); however, these reports are likely due to the frequency of this variant and not
            a reflection of its role in hearing loss.

comment2:   The Phe335Leu variant in SLC26A4 has been reported in 27 affected probands with hearing loss, 22 of whom had documented temporal bone abnormalities, and was
            absent from 1298 control chromosomes tested (Campbell 2001, Prasad 2004, Pryor 2005, Madden 2007, Smanich 2007, Yang 2007, Pera 2008, Choi 2009, Dai 2009, Yang
            2009, Pourova 2010, Rodriguez 2010, LMM unpublished cases). Three of these cases had a pathogenic variant on the second allele. Functional in vitro analyses
            suggest that the variant protein may have a mild reduction in activity (Choi 2009). In summary, this data suggests that this variant is likely pathogenic.

comment2:   The Arg3189Trp variant (CDH23) has been reported in the literature twice and was absent from 200 controls (Zheng 2005, Ouyang 2005). However, we suspect that
            the two reports were not independent and represent the same patient, who may also represent the present patient, based upon the co-occurrence of this variant
            and the Tyr16fs variant noted in one of the papers. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do
            not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, the clinical significance of this variant cannot be determined with certainty at
            this time.

comment2:   The Arg636Ser variant in RBM20 has been reported in 3 families with DCM, segregated with disease in 6 affected relatives from 2 families, and was absent from
            960 race-matched control chromosomes (Brauch 2009). In addition, this variant has been identified by our laboratory in 1 individual with DCM and one individual
            with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Functional studies indicate this variant may lead to altered TTN splicing, another gene encoding a protein that is strongly
            associated with DCM (Guo 2012); however, this in vitro assay may not accurately represent biological function. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid
            properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Arg636Ser variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive
            enough to determine pathogenicity. In addition, this variant lies within exon 9, which encodes a conserved protein domain where other pathogenic variants have
            been reported (Brauch 2009, Li 2010). In summary, this variant is likely to be pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its
            clinical significance.

comment2:   The Arg636His variant in RBM20 has been reported in 2 individuals with DCM, was absent from over 1500 control chromosomes, and segregated with disease in 3
            affected relatives (Brauch 2009, Li 2010). Our laboratory has identified this variant in 2 individuals with DCM, as well as in 3 affected relatives (an
            additional affected individual likely carried the variant based on other familial test results). Other variants at this position (Arg636Ser and Arg636Cys) and
            in nearby positions have also shown absence in controls and segregation with disease, suggesting that this region may be a hotspot for disease-associated
            variants (Brauch 2009, Li 2010). Arginine (Arg) at position 636 is highly conserved in evolution, suggesting that a change at this position is not tolerated. In
            summary, the available data supports that the Arg636His variant is likely pathogenic, but additional information is needed to fully establish its clinical
            significance.

comment2:   Gly384Cys in exon 11 of MYH14: This variant has been reported as a de novo variant in one individual with moderate sensorineural hearing loss (Donaudy 2004).

comment2:   The Tyr652Cys variant in NEXN has been reported in 2 individuals with clinical features and a family history of DCM and was absent from 2502 control chromosomes
            (Hassel 2009). This variant has been identified in 1/8174 European American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project
            (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs137853197), though this may have represented a pre-symptomatic individual. Additionally, animal models in zebrafish
            have shown that this variant affects protein function and can lead to dilation of heart tissue (Hassel 2009). Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid
            properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Tyr652Cys variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive
            enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, although this data supports that the Tyr652Cys variant may be pathogenic, additional studies are needed to fully

comment1:   Converted during submission to pathogenic.;The C532Y missense mutation has not been previously reported as a disease-causing mutation nor is it a known benign
            polymorphism. C532Y is considered to be a semi-conservative amino acid substitution as Tyrosine is a larger and bulkier polar residue than the normal Cysteine.
            Cys532 is highly conserved across species and the loss of a Cysteine residue is likely to affect disulfide bonding. Other pathogenic missense mutations (W531C
            and G534R) have been reported in neighboring codons (Sarkozy et al., 2009, Rodriquez-Viciana et al., 2008).

comment1:   The Gln1061X variant in MYBPC3 has been reported in the literature in six HCM probands, segregated in 12 affected or clinically suspicious relatives across five
            families and was absent from 328 healthy control chromosomes (Jaaskelaine 2002, Poutanen 2006). The families were all of Finnish ancestry, and haplotype
            analysis suggests that this variant could be a founder mutation in this population (Jaaskelaine 2002). In addition, this variant has not been identified in
            large and broad populations by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS). Gln1061X is a nonsense variant leading to a premature
            termination codon at position 1061, which is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein. Heterozygous loss of function of the MYBPC3 gene is an
            established disease mechanism in HCM patients. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM) based
            upon segregation studies, absence from controls, and established disease mechanism.

comment1:   The Arg663His variant in MYH7 has previously been reported in &gt;40 probands with HCM, was shown to segregate with disease in &gt;20 affected family members,
            and was absent in 1,300 control chromosomes (Gruver 1999, Greber-Platzer 2001, Mohiddin 2003, Richard 2003, Van Driest 2004, Song 2005, Ingles 2005, LMM
            unpublished data). In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM) based upon segregation studies and
            absence from controls.

comment1:   The Ala1379Thr variant has been reported in 4 families with HCM, segregated with disease in multiple individuals in 3 families, and was absent from at least 200
            control chromosomes (Blair 2002, Richard 2003). Therefore, the Ala1379Thr variant meets our criteria for pathogenicity (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM) based
            upon segregation studies and absence from controls and is highly likely to be causative for disease.
