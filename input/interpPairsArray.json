The I269T variant in the ACTC1 gene has not been reported previously as a disease-causing mutation or as a benign polymorphism to our knowledge, but this variant has been observed in other unrelated individuals tested for DCM at GeneDx. I269T results in a non-conservative amino acid substitution of a non-polar Isoleucine with a neutral, polar Threonine. While the Ile269 residue is not uniformly conserved across species, variation is limited to other non-polar amino acids at this position. In silico analysis predicts I269T is damaging to the protein structure/function. Mutations in nearby residues (M271V, S273F) have been reported in association with cardiomyopathy, supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. Furthermore, I269T was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. In summary, I269T is a good candidate for a disease-causing mutation. The variant is found in DCM,DCM-CRDM panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_005159.4","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(ACTG1):c.414C>T (p.Ala138=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000150145","source":"Genetic Services Laboratory, University of Chicago","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jun 21 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000204714","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Apr 30 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Ala138Ala in Exon 04 of ACTG1: This variant is not expected to have clinical significance because it does not alter an amino acid residue, is not located within the splice consensus sequence, and has been identified in 0.1% (3/3738) of African American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs143978597)."}],"transcript":"NM_001614.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(ACTG1):c.471C>T (p.Asp157=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000060781","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jan 17 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Asp157Asp in exon 4 of ACTG1: This variant is not expected to have clinical significance because it does not alter an amino acid residue, is not located within the splice consensus sequence, and it has been identified in 0.5% (39/8600) of European American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs11549222)"},{"scv":"SCV000150147","source":"Genetic Services Laboratory, University of Chicago","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"","comments":"Likely benign based on allele frequency in 1000 Genomes Project or ESP global frequency and its presence in a patient with a rare or unrelated disease phenotype.

This variant has been reported in one individual with Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) who carried a second APC variant as well (Azzopardi 2008). APC Arg414Cys was not observed at significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server. This variant is a non-conservative substitution of a positive polar amino acid for a neutral polar one, altering a position that is well conserved throughout evolution and is not located in a known functional domain. Multiple in silico algorithms predict that this variant may be damaging to protein structure and function. Based on the currently available information, we consider APC Arg414Cys to be a variant of unknown significance.

This variant has been reported in an individual with multiple colorectal adenomas (defined as 11-99 adenomas); however, the exact number in this particular individual is unknown (Azzopardi 2008). APC Ala1446Thr was not found in any of the 969 healthy controls in this study and has not been observed at significant allele frequency in the NHLBI ESP Exome Variant Server, indicating it is not a common benign variant in European American and African American populations. This variant is a non-conservative substitution of a neutral, non-polar amino acid for a neutral, polar one. Although Ala1446Thr is located in the large central portion of the APC gene known as the mutation cluster region (Minde 2011), it alters a position that is highly variable throughout evolution and is not located in any of the repeat segments involved in beta-catenin binding. Furthermore, Azzopardi et al. (2008) also demonstrated that Ala1446Thr has no impact on beta-catenin downregulation, one known function of the APC gene. In silico analyses predict this variant to have a benign effect on protein structure and function.

This variant has been reported in one Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) patient, along with APC Arg1676Gly (Azzopardi 2008). APC Pro2467Thr was not observed at significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server. This variant is a non-conservative substitution in which a neutral non-polar amino acid is replaced with a neutral polar one, altering a position that is only moderately conserved throughout evolution and is not located in a known functional domain.

Based on the currently available information, we consider APC Pro2467Thr to be a variant of unknown significance.

There is conflicting literature regarding the association of this variant with breast cancer. ATM c.1066-6T&gt;G has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (Broeks 2000) and was seen to segregate with breast cancer in two families in an analysis by Chenevix-Trench et al.

A large meta-analysis found no significant difference in the frequency of this mutation in cases versus controls (Ding 2011). Functional studies have demonstrated skipping of exon 11 in ATM mRNA transcripts, which results in a premature termination codon (DÃ¶rk 2001, Chenevix-Trench 2002). However, skipping of exon 11 was also noted to occur in control individuals in a smaller percentage of transcripts than in heterozygous and homozygous carriers. An additional in vivo functional study suggests that this variant acts in a dominant-negative way, and thus the wild-type enzyme is not able to function normally in its presence (Chenevix-Trench 2002).

This variant has been observed primarily in individuals with a history of leukemia and breast cancer (Thorstensen 2003, Liberzon 2004, Broeks 2008). ATM Val410Ala has been suggested by Edvardsen et al.

ATM Val410Ala was observed in multiple subpopulations, with the highest allele frequency of 0.2% (19/8596) in European Americans in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, not frequent enough to be considered a benign polymorphism. Since Valine and Alanine share similar properties, this is considered a conservative amino acid substitution.

Multiple in silico models predict this variant results in the gain of a strong cryptic splice acceptor site just upstream of the natural splice accurate site, and to possibly cause abnormal gene splicing. This mutation, previously referred to as IVS16-10T&gt;G, has been reported in at least four individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia and has been shown to create a new splice acceptor site resulting in the addition of nine nucleotides and subsequently a truncated protein (Telatar 1997, Teraoka 1999, Becker-Catania 2000, Buzin 2003). The thymine (T) nucleotide that is altered is well conserved across species. Based on the current evidence, we consider this mutation to be pathogenic. The presence of one mutation in the ATM gene has been shown to increase a woman's lifetime risk to develop breast cancer. Two studies independently estimated that female heterozygous ATM mutation carriers have approximately a two-fold increase risk for breast cancer (RR = 2.2-2.4) (Thompson 2005, Renwick 2006, Tavtigian 2009). Thompson et al. (2005) studied 1160 ATM mutation carriers and concluded that female heterozygous ATM mutation carriers who are less than 50 years of age had a significantly increased risk for breast cancer (RR = 4.9) compared to women over 50 years of age where a statistically significant risk could not be identified. One study suggests an increased risk for colon cancer, but the confidence intervals are wide (Thompson 2005). An association with pancreatic cancer has also been proposed. A recent study of 166 unrelated familial pancreatic cancer patients revealed that 2.4% carried an ATM mutation, and of families with 3 or more cases of pancreatic cancer, 4.6% carried an ATM mutation (Roberts 2012). Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), an autosomal recessive condition, is caused by two mutations (one affecting each allele) in the ATM gene. This multisystem disorder is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, telangiectasias, immunodeficiency, and increased cancer risks. If an ATM mutation carrier's partner is also heterozygous for an ATM mutation, the risk to have a child with A-T is 25% for each pregnancy.

Importantly, this variant has been shown to result in reduced radiation-induced kinase activity andhigher chromosome instability in transfected cells (Scott 2002). ATM Val2716Ala was not observed in approximately6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it isnot a common benign variant in these populations. Since Valine and Alanine share similar properties, this isconsidered a conservative amino acid substitution. ATM Val2716Ala alters a position that is highly conserved acrossspecies and is located in within the PI3K/PI4K domain (Stracker 2013). In silico analyses predict that this variant isprobably damaging to protein structure and function.

The deletion and insertion results in the replacement of two amino acids (a Serine and a Valine) with two others (an Arginine and an Isoleucine) on the same chromosome. The two individual adjacent missense variants, Ser2855Arg and Val2856Ile, are in a highly conserved region within the ATM PI3K and PI4K domains. This combined amino acid change has been reported in a woman with breast cancer and in a patient with Ataxia-Telengiectasia (Hacia 1998, Tavtigian 2009). Furthermore, a functional study showed reduced levels of ATM protein and an absence of kinase activity (Barone 2009). Based on current information, we consider this to be a pathogenic mutation. One mutation in the ATM gene has been estimated to increase the relative risk of female breast cancer about 2-fold over the general population (Thompson 2005, Renwick 2006) resulting in a lifetime risk of approximately 25-30%. According to one study, breast cancer risk in women under age 50 who carry one ATM mutation is nearly 5 times the age-matched general population risk which translates to approximately a 10% risk (Thompson 2005).

BARD1 Lys207Arg was observed with an allele frequency of 0.2% in 1000 Genomes and 0.7% in African Americans in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server. This variant is a conservative substitution of one positive polar amino acid for another, altering a position that is moderately conserved throughout evolution and is not located in a known functional domain. In silico analyses predict this variant to have a benign effect on protein structure and function. Based on currently available information, it is unclear whether BARD1 Lys207Arg is a pathogenic mutation or a benign variant. Furthermore, BARD1 has been only recently described in association with cancer predisposition and the risks are not well understood.The variant is found in HEREDICANCER,BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000183941","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Sep 27 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000465.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BBS1):c.700G>A (p.Glu234Lys)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000033172","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Oct 16 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000052053","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_024649.4","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BBS10):c.424G>A (p.Asp142Asn)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000052051","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000202225","source":"Emory Genetics Laboratory","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jan 30 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_024685.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BBS4):c.1061T>C (p.Ile354Thr)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000041554 ","source":"GeneReviews","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Oct 13 2009 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000172641","source":"Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences Kyoto University","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_033028.4","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BCKDHA):c.116C>A (p.Pro39His)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000111092","source":"Emory Genetics Laboratory","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Aug 17 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000150424","source":"Genetic Services Laboratory, University of Chicago","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"","comments":"Likely benign based on allele frequency in 1000 Genomes Project or ESP global frequency and its presence in a patient with a rare or unrelated disease phenotype.

Serine to a Leucine (TCG&gt;TTG) in exon 10. This variant was observed in 2/140 Latina women with breast cancer and a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer and 0/48 cancer-free Latina controls (McKean-Cowdin 2005). This variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, suggesting it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Serine and Leucine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. BRCA1 Ser784Leu alters a position that is highly conserved through mammals and is located in DNA binding domain (Narod 2004). In silico analyses are inconsistent regarding the effect this variant may have on protein structure and function. Based on currently available information, it is unclear whether BRCA1 Ser784Leu is a pathogenic mutation or a benign variant.

10 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"This variant is denoted BRCA1 c.2910A&gt;C at the cDNA level, p.Lys970Asn (K970N) at the protein level, and results in the change of a Lysine to an Asparagine (AAA&gt;AAC) in exon 10. This variant has not, to our knowledge, been published in the literature as either a mutation or a benign polymorphism. BRCA1 Lys970Asn was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Lysine and Asparagine differ in some properties, this is considered a semi-conservative amino acid substitution. BRCA1 Lys970Asn alters a position that is variable across species and is located within the DNA-binding domain (Narod 2004). In silico analyses predict that this variant is unlikely to alter protein structure or function. Based on currently available information, it is unclear whether BRCA1 Lys970Asn is a pathogenic mutation or a benign variant. The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000185724","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Oct 22 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.2910A>C (p.Lys970Asn)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000115105","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jan 25 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000185724","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Oct 22 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.2963C>T (p.Ser988Leu)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053671","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Feb  1 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000209948","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Oct  2 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.301+7G>A","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053676","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Mar 14 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000144958","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.301+8T>C","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000144959","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Feb 20 2004 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000167225","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Mar 14 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,BRCA panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.302-3C>G","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053678","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Nov 20 2008 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000144969","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Feb 20 2004 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.3024G>A (p.Met1008Ile)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043171","source":"Biesecker Laboratory -

Based on a multifactorial likelihood algorithm using genetic, in silico and statistical data, this sequence change has been determined to have a very low probability of being pathogenic (PMID: 17924331, 21990134).

c.427G&gt;A at the cDNA level, p.Glu143Lys (E143K) at the protein level, and results in the change of a Glutamic Acid to a Lysine (GAA&gt;AAA) in exon 6. Wei et al. (2008) demonstrated that this variant interacts with BARD1 and exhibits ubiquitination activity; however, the variant caused reduced accumulation of BRCA1 to double strand breaks. In another functional study, BRCA1 Glu143Lys was found to have functional homology directed recombination, but showed partially defective single-strand annealing (SSA) functionality (Towler 2013). However; BRCA1 Glu143Lys was strongly predicted by Lindor et al. (2012) to be benign based on tumor pathology, clinical histories, family studies and co-occurrence with deleterious mutations.BRCA1 Glu143Lys was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Glutamic Acid and Lysine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. BRCA1 Glu143Lys alters a position that is moderately conserved across species and is not located in a known functional domain. In silico analyses predict that this variant is unlikely to alter protein structure or function. Based on currently available information, it is unclear whether BRCA1 Glu143Lys is a pathogenic mutation or a benign variant. The variant is found in MODRISK-HEREDICV3 panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000145475","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Feb 20 2004

at the cDNA level or p.Ala1623Gly (A1623G) at the protein level, and results in the change of an Alanine (GCT) with a Glycine (GGT) in exon 15. BRCA1 c.4868C&gt;G, also reported as c.4987C&gt;G by alternative nomenclature, has been observed in individuals with breast and ovarian cancer (Alsop 2012, Chiang 2012). Since Alanine and Glycine share similar properties, this is considered a conservative amino acid substitution however this change has been shown by in silico models to create a new cryptic splice donor site in exon 15. An in vitro study demonstrated that this mutation results in abnormal gene splicing causing a deletion of 119 nucleotides of the BRCA1 gene (Walker 2010). Easton et al. (2007) report 30:1 odds in favor of causality based on personal and family history of cancer, co-occurrence, and co-segregation data. This variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, suggesting it is not a common benign variant in these populations. BRCA1 Ala1623Gly alters a position that is semi-conserved across species and is not located in a known functional domain. Based on the currently available information, we consider BRCA1 Ala1623Gly to be a variant, expected pathogenic.While the possibility that this variant is benign cannot be excluded, it is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation. Pathogenic missense mutations in this gene are indicative of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC), an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to early onset breast cancer, ovarian and fallopian tube cancer, as well as other cancers. Breast and ovarian cancer are the predominant BRCA1-related cancers that unaffected female mutation carriers are at risk to develop. The lifetime risk for breast cancer is estimated to be 57 to 84% and the lifetime risk for ovarian cancer is estimated to be 24 to 54% (Antoniou 2003, Chen 2007, Ford 1998). BRCA1 mutations have also been reported in women with fallopian tube carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, and uterine serous carcinoma (Levine 2003, Pennington 2013). Graeser et al. (2009) found that women who harbor a pathogenic BRCA1 mutation have an increased risk for contralateral breast cancer that is dependent on age at initial diagnosis. It is estimated that the risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years of the first diagnosis if initially diagnosed less than age 40 years of age is 31%, between the ages of 40 and 50 is 11% and after the age of 50 is 8%. Additionally, it is estimated that the risk to develop a second breast cancer within 25 years of their first diagnosis if initially diagnosed less than age 40 years of age is 63%, between the ages of 40 and 50 is 44% and after the age of 50 is 20%. Other cancer risks associated with a BRCA1 pathogenic variant include approximately a 20% risk for prostate cancer in male carriers (Thompson 2002), a 4% risk for male breast cancer (Liede 2004), and an estimated 1 to 3% risk for pancreatic cancer in both men and women (Brose 2002, Thompson 2002). The variant is found in BRCA1-BRCA2,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000145198","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.4868C>G (p.Ala1623Gly)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053795","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Feb 24 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000145198","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.4883T>C (p.Met1628Thr)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043155","source":"Biesecker Laboratory -

Multiple in vitro functional assays demonstrated impairment, specifically with respect to phosphopeptide binding activity, though in other assays the variant performed as well as wild-type (Williams 2004, Lovelock 2007, Lee 2010, Chang 2011). In addition, the variant was weakly predicted to be disease-causing by multiple models based on tumor pathology, clinical histories, family studies and co-occurrence with deleterious mutations (Chenevix-Trench 2006, Lindor 2012). The largest study of this variant was performed by Spurdle et al. (2012), who conducted genetic testing in 111 individuals from 30 families with this variant. The authors concluded, based on intermediate functional results and a lower risk profile in their cohort than would be expected of a typical pathogenic mutation, that BRCA1 Arg1699Gln might be a low-penetrance allele.BRCA1 Arg1699Gln was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant is a non-conservative substitution of a positive polar amino acid for a neutral polar one, altering a position that is well conserved throughout evolution and is located in the BRCA1 carboxyl terminal (BRCT) region of the transcriptional transactivation domain (TAD) (Spurdle 2012). Multiple in silico algorithms predict that this variant may be damaging to protein structure and function. Based on the currently available information, we consider BRCA1 Arg1699Gln to be an expected pathogenic variant.This variant, while functionally abnormal in laboratory studies, does not seem to confer the typical BRCA1 risks of cancer, and the risks presented here might be overestimates for the current patient. A clearly pathogenic mutation in this gene would be indicative of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to breast and ovarian cancer as well as other cancers. The predominant BRCA1-related cancer risks for women who have not been diagnosed with cancer have been estimated to be 57% - 84% lifetime risk for breast cancer and 24% - 54% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer (Antoniou 2003, Chen 2007, Ford 1998). BRCA1 mutations have also been reported in women with fallopian tube carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, and uterine serous carcinoma (Levine 2003, Pennington 2013). Women with BRCA1/2 mutations also have an increased risk for contralateral breast cancer. Women with BRCA mutations whose first cancer was diagnosed under age 40 have a 21-31% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years and a 63% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 25 years. Women with BRCA mutations whose first cancer was diagnosed between ages 40 and 50 have an 11-13% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years and a 44-49% risk within 25 years. Women with BRCA mutations whose first cancer was diagnosed after age 50 have an 8% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years and a 20% risk within 25 years (Graeser 2009). Other cancer risks associated with a BRCA1 mutation include approximately 3% risk for pancreatic cancer (The Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium 1999), a 20% risk for prostate cancer (Thompson 2002), and 4% risk for male breast cancer (Liede 2004). The variant is found in HIRISK-BR-HEREDIC,BRCA1-BRCA2 panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000053817","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Jul 16 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000145310","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000153998","source":"Counsyl","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Jan  2 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000212005","source":"Division of Human Genetics Innsbruck,Medical University Innsbruck","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Feb 11 2015 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.5096G>A (p.Arg1699Gln)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043748","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Aug 14 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000053817","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Jul 16 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.5096G>A (p.Arg1699Gln)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043748","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Aug 14 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000145310","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.5096G>A (p.Arg1699Gln)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043748","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Aug 14 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000153998","source":"Counsyl","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Jan  2 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.5096G>A (p.Arg1699Gln)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043748","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Aug 14 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000212005","source":"Division of Human Genetics Innsbruck,Medical University Innsbruck","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Feb 11 2015 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.5117G>A (p.Gly1706Glu)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053819","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"May 17 2010 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000145318","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.5152+10A>G","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053822","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"May 24 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000145334","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000209985","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jul 29 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BRCA,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.5152+10A>G","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053822","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"May 24 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000209985","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jul 29 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BRCA,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_007294.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA1):c.5152+20T>A","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000153856","source":"Invitae","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jun 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"This sequence change has been reported in patients affected with breast cancer (PMID: 19563646) and is present in the population at a low frequency (0.015% MAF in ESP).

This variant has been observed in individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer (Akbari 2011, Hondow 2011, Domchek 2013). BRCA1 Val1736Ala has been reported in an individual with early-onset ovarian cancer, microcephaly, short stature, developmental delay, and dysmorphic features (Domchek 2013). In addition, this individual had a pathogenic BRCA1 frameshift mutation in trans; however, the authors concluded, based on functional studies and tumor analysis for loss of heterozygosity, that BRCA1 Val1736Ala is deleterious (Domchek 2013). Another functional study found that this variant has impaired function as compared to wild type (Carvalho 2007). Karchin et al. (2007) and Iversen et al. (2011) classified this variant as deleterious based on computation algorithms. However, The variant was predicted by Easton et al. (2007) to be neutral based on clinical histories, family studies and co-occurrence with deleterious mutations. BRCA1 Val1736Ala was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Valine and Alanine share similar properties, this is considered a conservative amino acid substitution. BRCA1 Val1736Ala alters a position that is well conserved across species and is located in the BRCT1 domain (UniProt). In silico analyses predict that this variant is probably damaging to protein structure and function. Based on the currently available information, we consider BRCA1 Val1736Ala to be a variant, expected pathogenic.While the possibility of neutrality cannot be excluded, this variant is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation. A pathogenic mutation in this gene is indicative of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to early onset breast cancer, ovarian and fallopian tube cancer, as well as other cancers. Breast and ovarian cancer are the predominant BRCA1-related cancers that unaffected female mutation carriers are at risk to develop. The lifetime risk for breast cancer is estimated to be 57 to 84% and the lifetime risk for ovarian cancer is estimated to be 24 to 54% (Antoniou 2003, Chen 2007, Ford 1998). BRCA1 mutations have also been reported in women with fallopian tube carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, and uterine serous carcinoma (Levine 2003, Pennington 2013). Graeser et al. (2009) found that women who harbor pathogenic BRCA1 or 2 mutations have an increased risk for contralateral breast cancer that is dependent on age at initial diagnosis. It is estimated that the risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years of the first diagnosis if initially diagnosed less than 40 years of age is 21 to 31%, between the ages of 40 and 50 is 11 to 13% and after the age of 50 is 8%. Additionally, it is estimated that the risk to develop a second breast cancer within 25 years of their first diagnosis if initially diagnosed less than 40 years of age is 63%, between the ages of 40 and 50 is 44 to 49% and after the age of 50 is 20%. Other cancer risks associated with a BRCA1 pathogenic variant include approximately a 20% risk for prostate cancer in male carriers (Thompson 2002), a 4% risk for male breast cancer (Liede 2004), and an estimated 1 to 3% risk for pancreatic cancer in both men and women (Brose 2002, Thompson 2002). The variant is found in BRCA panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000145392","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA1)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002

c.661G&gt;T at the cDNA level, p.Ala221Ser (A221S) at the protein level, and results in the change of an Alanine to a Serine (GCA&gt;TCA) in exon 9. BRCA1 Ala221Ser was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Since Alanine and Serine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. BRCA1 Ala221Ser alters a position that is moderately conserved across species and is not located in a known functional domain. BRCA1 Ala221Ser was classified as neutral or of little clinical significance based on analysis of sequence variation among various species (Abkevich 2004). This variant has been reported 2 times in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database as having unknown clinical significance. In silico analyses are inconsistent regarding the effect this variant may have on protein structure and function. Based on currently available information, it is unclear whether BRCA1 Ala221Ser is a pathogenic mutation or a benign variant.

RT-PCR revealed an increased percentage of a transcript without exon 11, leading to the hypothesis that this change may induce exon 11 skipping. Exon 11 skipping happens in normal control individuals, although to a lesser degree. PMID: 22615956 performed a minigene assay in cell culture which revealed 3 splicing isoforms: Fulllength (FL), partial exon 11 deletion (D11q), and full exon 11 deletion (D11).

This variant has not, to our knowledge, been published in the literature as either a mutation or a benign polymorphism. BRCA2 Lys502Gln was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Lysine and Glutamine differ in some properties, this is considered a semi-conservative amino acid substitution. BRCA2 Lys502Gln alters a position that is moderately conserved across species and is not located in a known functional domain. In silico analyses predict that this variant is unlikely to alter protein structure or function. Based on currently available information, it is unclear whether BRCA2 Lys502Gln is a pathogenic mutation or a benign variant. The variant is found in TSCA-BRCAV1-1 panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.1514T>C (p.Ile505Thr)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043197","source":"Biesecker Laboratory -

a Threonine to an Arginine (ACA&gt;AGA) in exon 11. This variant has been identified in at least 3 individuals with breast or ovarian cancer (De Sanjose 2003, Balia 2011, Alsop 2012). Balia et al. (2011) found no tumoral loss of heterozygosity in the corresponding breast tumor. A functional study in a human cell line found that this variant did not increase spontaneous homologous recombination as compared to wild type, leading authors to conclude that it is likely not pathogenic (Balia 2011). However, another functional study in yeast found that BRCA2 Thr1011Arg did not induce any recombination events, a result similar to the pathogenic control (Spugnesi 2013). In addition, this variant demonstrated impaired binding to both APRIN and RAD51 proteins (Brough 2012). BRCA2 Thr1011Arg was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Since Threonine and Arginine differ in some properties, this is considered a semi-conservative amino acid substitution. BRCA2 Thr1011Arg alters a position that is highly conserved through vertebrates and is located in the BRCA2 1 repeat (Roy 2011, UniProt). In silico analyses predict that this variant is probably damaging to protein structure and function. Based on currently available information, it is unclear whether BRCA2 Thr1011Arg is a pathogenic mutation or a benign variant. The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000146158","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA2)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Feb 20 2004

This variant has not, to our knowledge, been published in the literature as either a mutation or a benign polymorphism. BRCA2 Lys1239Glu was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Since Lysine and Glutamic Acid differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution and is likely to affect protein integrity. BRCA2 Lys1239Glu alters a position that is moderately conserved across species and is located within the BRC motif 2 region (UniProt). In silico analyses predict that this variant is unlikely to alter protein structure or function. Based on currently available information, it is unclear whether BRCA2 Lys1239Glu is a pathogenic mutation or a benign variant.

This sequence change has been shown to co-occur with two different BRCA2 and five different BRCA1 pathogenic sequence changes in the Universal Mutation Database (http://www.umd.be/BRCA2/4DACTION/Web_D_splice/7618). In an internal Invitae research study, this sequence change was also shown to co-occur with a pathogenic BRCA1 truncating variant. In vitro studies have demonstrated that this intronic change does affect mRNA splicing, resulting in a portion of BRCA2 mRNAs lacking exon 3 above the already 5% leaky altered splicing seen in wild-type samples (PMID: 20215541, 21939546).

This variant was predicted by Lindor et al. (2012) to be neutral based on tumor pathology, clinical histories, family studies and co-occurrence with deleterious mutations. BRCA2 Leu2396Phe was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Leucine and Phenylalanine share similar properties, this is considered a conservative amino acid substitution. BRCA2 Leu2396Phe alters a position that is variable across species and is located within a region that interacts with FANCD2.

This variant, previously reported as 7793C&gt;T using alternate nomenclature, was observed in two individuals with breast and/or ovarian cancer (Fries 2002, Caux-Moncoutier 2011). In silico analyses and published computational models predict this variant to have a deleterious effect on protein structure and function (Karchin 2008). BRCA2 Ser2522Phe was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Serine and Phenylalanine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution.

This variant was observed in an individual with early onset prostate cancer (Kote-Jarai 2011). BRCA2 Asn277Lys was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant is a semi-conservative substitution in which a neutral polar amino acid is replaced with a positive polar one, altering a position that is only moderately conserved throughout evolution and is not located in a known functional domain.

This mutation destroys a canonical splice acceptor site and is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing, leading to either an abnormal message that is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or to an abnormal protein product. Functional analysis identified that this mutation results in abnormal splicing (Acedo 2012, Santos 2014). This mutation has been reported in the homozygous state in an individual with Fanconi Anemia (Howlett 2002). Based on the current evidence, we consider this mutation to be pathogenic. and is indicative of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to breast and ovarian cancer as well as other cancers. The predominant BRCA2-related cancer risks for women who have not been diagnosed with cancer have been estimated as 41% - 84% lifetime risk for breast cancer and 11% - 27% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer (Ford 1998, Risch 2006). BRCA2 mutations have also been reported in women with fallopian tube carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, and uterine serous carcinoma (Levine 2003, Biron-Shental 2006). Women with BRCA1/2 mutations also have an increased risk for contralateral breast cancer. Women with BRCA mutations whose first cancer was diagnosed under age 40 have a 21-31% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years and a 63% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 25 years. Women with BRCA mutations whose first cancer was diagnosed between ages 40 and 50 have an 11-13% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years and a 44-49% risk within 25 years. Women with BRCA mutations whose first cancer was diagnosed after age 50 have an 8% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years and a 20% risk within 25 years (Graeser 2009). Other cancer risks associated with a BRCA2 mutation include up to a 7% risk for pancreatic cancer (Ozcelik 1997, The Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium 1999), up to a 34% risk for prostate cancer in male carriers (Thompson 2001), and up to a 7% risk for male breast cancer (Liede 2004).Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive condition that can be caused by two mutations (one from each parent) in the BRCA2 gene. This condition is characterized by an increased risk for malignancy in children including leukemia and certain solid tumors as well as physical abnormalities and bone marrow failure. If a BRCA2 mutation carrier's partner is also heterozygous for a BRCA2 mutation, the risk to have a child with FA is 25% with each pregnancy. The variant is found in BRCA panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.8567A>C (p.Glu2856Ala)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000054359","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"May  1 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000154095","source":"Counsyl","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Apr  8 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000202304","source":"Emory Genetics Laboratory","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"May  1 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000043231","source":"Biesecker Laboratory - ClinSeq Project, NHGRI","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Jul 13 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000207353","source":"Pathway Genomics","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Nov  6 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.8567A>C (p.Glu2856Ala)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000054359","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"May  1 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000202304","source":"Emory Genetics Laboratory","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"May  1 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.8567A>C (p.Glu2856Ala)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000054359","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"May  1 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000043231","source":"Biesecker Laboratory - ClinSeq Project, NHGRI","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Jul 13 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.8567A>C (p.Glu2856Ala)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000054359","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"May  1 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000207353","source":"Pathway Genomics","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Nov  6 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.8662C>T (p.Arg2888Cys)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000109443","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Oct  5 2009 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000147430","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA2)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.8687G>A (p.Arg2896His)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043232","source":"Biesecker Laboratory - ClinSeq Project, NHGRI","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jul 13 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000183797","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Apr  4 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000109246","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Dec  8 2010 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.8687G>A (p.Arg2896His)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043232","source":"Biesecker Laboratory - ClinSeq Project, NHGRI","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jul 13 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000109246","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Dec  8 2010 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.8702G>A (p.Gly2901Asp)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000054371","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Jan 22 2010 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000147441","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA2)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jun 12 2000 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000210479","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 15 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"This variant is denoted BRCA2 c.8702G&gt;A at the cDNA level, p.Gly2901Asp (G2901D) at the protein level, and results in the change of a Glycine to an Aspartic Acid (GGT&gt;GAT) in exon 21.

This variant has not, to our knowledge, been published in the literature as either a mutation or a benign polymorphism. Multiple in silico splicing programs predict that this variant strengthens a cryptic splice site, which might cause abnormal splicing. BRCA2 Tyr296Cys was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, altering a position that is highly variable throughout evolution and is not located in a known functional domain.

12:00:00:000AM","comments":"This variant is denoted BRCA2 IVS25+3A&gt;T or c.9501+3A&gt;T and consists of an A&gt;T nucleotide substitution at the +3 position of intron 25 of the BRCA2 gene. This variant has been observed in breast and/or ovarian cancer families (Papi 2009, Borg 2010). Though Bonnet et al. (2008) observed incomplete splicing associated with this variant, several other in vitro RNA studies established that BRCA2 c.9501+3A&gt;T induces complete skipping of exon 25 (Papi 2009, Borg 2010, Whiley 2011). These findings were confirmed by the Evidence-Based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles (ENIGMA) Splicing Working Group's study of 23 laboratories which concluded that BRCA2 c.9501+3A&gt;T produces unequivocal splicing aberrations (Whiley 2014). Based on the currently available information, we consider BRCA2 c.9501+3A&gt;T to be a variant, expected pathogenic. While the possibility that this variant is benign cannot be excluded, it is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation. A pathogenic mutation in this gene is indicative of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to breast and ovarian cancer as well as other cancers. The predominant BRCA2-related cancer risks for women who have not been diagnosed with cancer have been estimated as 41% - 84% lifetime risk for breast cancer and 11% - 27% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer (Ford 1998, Risch 2006). BRCA2 mutations have also been reported in women with fallopian tube carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, and uterine serous carcinoma (Levine 2003, Biron-Shental 2006). Women with BRCA1/2 mutations also have an increased risk for contralateral breast cancer. Women with BRCA mutations whose first cancer was diagnosed under age 40 have a 21-31% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years and a 63% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 25 years. Women with BRCA mutations whose first cancer was diagnosed between ages 40 and 50 have an 11-13% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years and a 44-49% risk within 25 years. Women with BRCA mutations whose first cancer was diagnosed after age 50 have an 8% risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years and a 20% risk within 25 years (Graeser 2009). Other cancer risks associated with a BRCA2 mutation include up to a 7% risk for pancreatic cancer (Ozcelik 1997, The Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium 1999), up to a 34% risk for prostate cancer in male carriers (Thompson 2001), and up to a 7% risk for male breast cancer (Liede 2004).Fanconi Anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive condition that can be caused by two mutations (one from each parent) in the BRCA2 gene. When two individuals each with a known pathogenic BRCA2 mutation have children, the risk of FA is 25% with each pregnancy. The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,BRCA,HIRISK-BR-HEREDIC panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000186226","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Mar 13 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000147652","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA2)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.9501+3A>T","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000054433","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Sep 16 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000186226","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Mar 13 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.9501+3A>T","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000054433","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Sep 16 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000147652","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA2)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.9501+9A>C","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000054434","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Oct  6 2008 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000147654","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA2)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.9502-12T>G","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000073855","source":"Invitae","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jun 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The interpretation for this sequence variant was made by Invitae based on the ACMG guidelines."},{"scv":"SCV000147656","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA2)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jun 21 1999 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.9547A>G (p.Ile3183Val)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000115078","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Sep 28 2010 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000184174","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Nov  4 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.956A>C (p.Asn319Thr)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000054439","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Sep  1 2008 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000145792","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA2)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May 29 2002 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000059.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(BRCA2):c.9581C>A (p.Pro3194Gln)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000054441","source":"Sharing Clinical Reports Project (SCRP)","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Feb  8 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000186278","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Apr 21 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000147668","source":"Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) (BRCA2)","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Feb 20 2004 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000073873","source":"Invitae","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jun 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The interpretation for this sequence variant was made by Invitae based on the ACMG guidelines."},{"scv":"SCV000210511","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 19 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"This variant is denoted BRCA2 c.9581C&gt;A at the cDNA level, p.Pro3194Gln (P3194Q) at the protein level, and results in the change of a Proline to a Glutamine (CCA&gt;CAA) in exon 26.

The normal sequence, with the bases that are deleted in brackets, is TTTG{TATG}GCCA. The deletion causes a frameshift, which changes a Cysteine to a Tryptophan at codon 3233 in exon 27, and creates a premature stop codon at position 15 of the new reading frame. This mutation is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation. BRCA2 9699_9702delTATG, previously reported as 9927del4, has been observed in association with breast and/or ovarian cancer and is listed as a clinically important mutation in the Breast Cancer Information Core Database (van der Hout 2006, BIC). We consider this mutation to be pathogenic and is indicative of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC), an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to breast and ovarian cancer as well as other cancers. Breast and ovarian cancer are the predominant BRCA2-related cancers that unaffected female mutation carriers are at risk to develop. The lifetime risk for breast cancer is estimated to be 41 to 84% and the lifetime risk for ovarian cancer is estimated to be 11 to 27% (Ford 1998, Risch 2006). BRCA2 mutations have also been reported in women with fallopian tube carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, and uterine serous carcinoma (Levine 2003, Biron-Shental 2006). Graeser et al. (2009) found that women who harbor a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation have an increased risk for contralateral breast cancer that is dependent on age at initial diagnosis. It is estimated that the risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years of the first diagnosis if initially diagnosed less than age 40 years of age is 21%, between the ages of 40 and 50 is 13% and after the age of 50 is 9%. Additionally, it is estimated that the risk to develop a second breast cancer within 25 years of their first diagnosis if initially diagnosed less than age 40 years of age is 63%, between the ages of 40 and 50 is 49% and after the age of 50 is 17%. Other cancer risks associated with a BRCA2 mutation include up to a 7% risk for pancreatic cancer (Ozcelik 1997, The Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium 1999), up to a 34% risk for prostate cancer in male carriers (Thompson 2001) and up to a 7% risk for male breast cancer (Liede 2004). BRCA2 mutations have also been associated with an increased risk for cutaneous malignant melanoma (Liede 2004, The Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium 1999).

The normal sequence, with the bases that are deleted in brackets, is TTTG{TATG}GCCA. The deletion causes a frameshift, which changes a Cysteine to a Tryptophan at codon 3233 in exon 27, and creates a premature stop codon at position 15 of the new reading frame. This mutation is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation. BRCA2 9699_9702delTATG, previously reported as 9927del4, has been observed in association with breast and/or ovarian cancer and is listed as a clinically important mutation in the Breast Cancer Information Core Database (van der Hout 2006, BIC). We consider this mutation to be pathogenic and is indicative of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC), an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to breast and ovarian cancer as well as other cancers. Breast and ovarian cancer are the predominant BRCA2-related cancers that unaffected female mutation carriers are at risk to develop. The lifetime risk for breast cancer is estimated to be 41 to 84% and the lifetime risk for ovarian cancer is estimated to be 11 to 27% (Ford 1998, Risch 2006). BRCA2 mutations have also been reported in women with fallopian tube carcinoma, primary peritoneal carcinoma, and uterine serous carcinoma (Levine 2003, Biron-Shental 2006). Graeser et al. (2009) found that women who harbor a pathogenic BRCA2 mutation have an increased risk for contralateral breast cancer that is dependent on age at initial diagnosis. It is estimated that the risk to develop a second breast cancer within 10 years of the first diagnosis if initially diagnosed less than age 40 years of age is 21%, between the ages of 40 and 50 is 13% and after the age of 50 is 9%. Additionally, it is estimated that the risk to develop a second breast cancer within 25 years of their first diagnosis if initially diagnosed less than age 40 years of age is 63%, between the ages of 40 and 50 is 49% and after the age of 50 is 17%.

This amino acid substitution results in the conservative replacement of a positively charged Lysine residue (AAG) with a positively-charged Arginine residue (AGG) at a position that is moderately conserved throughout evolution. BRIP1 Lys297Arg is located within the helicase domain. In silico analyses predict this variant to have a benign effect on protein structure and function. Lys297Arg has not been published in the literature as a mutation nor has it been reported as a benign polymorphism to our knowledge. This variant was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the 1000 Genomes Browser Database, nor in individuals of African American background in the NHLBI ESP Exome Variant Server (ESP), suggesting it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Lys297Arg was observed at an allele frequency of 0.2% (14/8600) in individuals of European backgrounds in ESP, not frequent enough to be considered a polymorphism. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether BRIP1 Lys297Arg is a pathogenic mutation or a benign variant. Furthermore, BRIP1 has been only recently described in association with cancer predisposition and the risks are not well understood.

This variant was observed in one woman (1/318) with early-onset lobular breast cancer and a family history of intestinal cancer, type unknown, but no known family history of gastric cancer. It was considered to be potentially pathogenic because in vitro analysis demonstrated that CDH1 Asp433Asn might interfere with calcium-dependent hemophilic binding due to close proximity with calcium ion-binding extracellular domain 3 (Schrader 2011). Li et al. (2013) identified CDH1 Asp433Asn in one Chinese individual with gastric cancer (1/282), and it was absent in 425 cancer-free controls. RNA splicing analysis in this study yielded normal-sized mRNA, demonstrating this variant does not induce splicing defects in E-cadherin. Thus, the authors concluded that CDH1 Asp433Asn is not disease causing.

Since Valine and Methionine share similar properties, this is considered a conservative amino acid substitution and is less likely to affect protein integrity. CDH1 Val832Met alters a position that is highly conserved across species and is located within the cytoplasmic domain as well as being involved in the recognition and binding of beta-catenin (Yabuta 2002, Suriano 2003, Figueiredo 2013). This variant was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Yabuta et al.

Tumor immunohistochemistry showed reduced E-cadherin and beta-catenin expression but no loss of heterozygosity. Another study identified this variant in a woman with a history of lobular breast cancer who reported a family history of various cancers, none of which were gastric (Schrader 2011). Mateus et al.

This variant is a non-conservative substitution in which a positive polar amino acid is replaced with a neutral polar one, altering a position that is variable throughout evolution and accepts non-conservative changes throughout mammals. CDH1 Arg224Cys is located in the cadherin1 domain (UniPROT, InterPro). CDH1 Arg224Cys was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant has been reported in one individual with sporadic lobular breast cancer and one individual with sporadic early-onset diffuse gastric cancer (Newman 2011, Corso 2011). Testing of the tumor sample from the gastric cancer patient did not detect any somatic mutations, promoter hypermethylation or loss of heterozygosity. In vitro studies showed normal protein function with respect to cell-cell aggregation and suppression of cell invasion leading Corso et al.

CDH1 Gly239Arg was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Glycine and Arginine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. CDH1 Gly239Arg alters a position that is highly conserved across species and is located in 1st Cadherin repeat domain in the extracellular topological domain (UniProt). This variant has been observed in individuals with personal and family histories of early onset diffuse gastric cancer, with ages at diagnosis between 28 and 33 (Kaurah 2007, More 2007, Kim 2013). Of note, one carrier, whose daughter and grandson were affected, was unaffected at age 79 (More 2007). While protein-based in silico analyses are inconsistent regarding the effect this variant may have on protein structure and function, splicing models predict this variant to create a cryptic splice site in exon 6, and functional assays confirm this abnormality. Both RT-PCR studies and minigene assays demonstrated abnormal splicing, with a deletion of the first 29 base pairs from exon 6 (Kaurah 2007). In addition, in vitro studies demonstrated deficient E-cadherin function with respect to intercellular adhesion and suppression of invasion (More 2007). Specifically, cells expressing mutant E-cadherin exhibited on average 13 times more matrigel-invading cells compared to the wild type CDH1 controls. Based on currently available information, we consider CDH1 Gly239Arg to be an expected pathogenic variant.While the possibility that this variant is benign cannot be excluded, it is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation.

The CDKN2A gene encodes the p16 protein and, using an alternate reading frame, the p14-ARF protein as well. At the protein level this variant is denoted p.Ser73Arg (S73R), and results in the change of a Serine to an Arginine (AGT&gt;CGT) in exon 2 of the p14-ARF protein. Of note, this variant also results in a change to the p16 protein; however, that amino acid substitution is silent (p.Arg58Arg). CDKN2A c.217A&gt;C has been observed in one individual with melanoma and no family history of melanoma in first degree relatives (Begg 2005). Another missense mutation, c.219T&gt;G, which results in the same Ser73Arg substitution in p14-ARF but results in p.Val59Gly in p16, has been reported in association with melanoma-prone families (Yakobson 2003, Puig 2005). Functional data suggests that the Val59Gly variant in p16 is the causative mutation rather than the Ser73Arg variant (Yakobson 2003). CDKN2A c.217A&gt;C was observed with an allele frequency of 0.6% (25/4050) in African Americans in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server. This variant is a semi-conservative substitution in which a neutral polar amino acid is replaced with a positive polar one, altering a position that is highly variable throughout evolution and is not located in a known functional domain. In silico analyses predict this variant to have a benign effect on protein structure and function. Based on the currently available information, we consider this to be a variant of unknown significance.

This variant is a non-conservative substitution of a positive polar amino acid for a neutral polar one, altering a position that is highly variable throughout evolution and is located in the activation loop of the kinase domain (UniProt). In silico analyses are inconsistent with regard to the effect this variant may have on protein structure and function. CHEK2 His371Tyr was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant has been reported as a likely pathogenic variant in association with familial breast cancer cases of Chinese ancestry and was identifed in 4.2% of such cases (Liu 2011). However, Liu et al (2011) also identified this variant in unselected breast cancer cases as well as controls at a frequency of 1.8% and 0.7%, respectively. In vitro functional studies have shown that CHEK2 His371Tyr exhibits decreased phosphorylation and CHEK2 kinase activity compared to normal, but not to the same degree as the negative control, a known kinase defective mutation (Liu 2011).

CHEK2 Asp438Tyr was shown to reduce kinase activity to 70% of the wild-type activity one study (Bell 2007). Additionally, this mutation has been reported in association with early-onset and/or hereditary prostate cancer (Seppala 2003, Bell 2007). CHEK2 Asp438Tyr has not been observed at significant allele frequency in individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, suggesting it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This mutation is a non-conservative substitution of a negative polar amino acid for a neutral polar one, altering a position that is well conserved throughout evolution and that is located in the protein kinase domain. Multiple in silico algorithms predict that this mutation may be damaging to protein structure and function. We therefore consider this mutation to be pathogenic and consistent with an increased cancer risk. Mutations in CHEK2 have been estimated to increase the risk of female breast cancer 1.6-fold over the general population resulting in a lifetime risk of approximately 20% (Desrichard 2011). Prostate cancer risk has been reported to be increased 1.5-fold over the general population resulting in a 24% lifetime risk (Seppala 2003). A higher risk of breast cancer has been observed in women with a CHEK2 mutation (the common 1100delC) who have a family history of bilateral breast cancer, and women with the same mutation who had been diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to have estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and were observed to have an increased risk for a second breast cancer within 20 years of initial diagnosis (Fletcher 2009, Weischer 2012). CHEK2 mutations have been found to be associated with familial and sporadic prostate cancer, though the data are inconsistent (Seppala 2003, Dong 2003). A risk for thyroid cancer of approximately 5% (4.9-fold increased risk) has been reported (Cybulski 2004). CHEK2 missense mutations have been associated with a 2-fold increase in colon cancer risk resulting in an 8%-10% lifetime risk and have been identified in patients with kidney cancer, thyroid cancer, and uterine papillary serous carcinoma (Cybulski 2004, Pennington 2013).

CHEK2 Thr476Met is a non-conservative substitution of a polar amino acid for a non-polar one and alters a position that is well conserved throughout evolution.

Prostate cancer risk has been reported to be increased 1.5-fold over the general population resulting in a 24% lifetime risk (Seppala 2003). A higher risk of breast cancer has been observed in women with a CHEK2 mutation (the common 1100delC) who have a family history of bilateral breast cancer, and women with the same mutation who had been diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to have estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and were observed to have an increased risk for a second breast cancer within 20 years of initial diagnosis (Fletcher 2009, Weischer 2012). CHEK2 mutations have been found to be associated with familial and sporadic prostate cancer, though the data are inconsistent (Seppala 2003, Dong 2003). A risk for thyroid cancer of approximately 5% (4.9-fold increased risk) has been reported (Cybulski 2004). CHEK2 missense mutations have been associated with a 2-fold increase in colon cancer risk resulting in an 8%-10% lifetime risk and have been identified in patients with kidney cancer, thyroid cancer, and uterine papillary serous carcinoma (Cybulski 2004, Pennington 2013). The variant is found in HEREDICANCER,BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000186804","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Nov 20 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007194.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(CHEK2):c.190G>A (p.Glu64Lys)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000149918","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Sep  3 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"This variant is denoted CHEK2 c.190G&gt;A at the cDNA level, p.Glu64Lys (E64K) at the protein level, and results in the change of a Glutamic Acid to a Lysine (GAG&gt;AAG) in exon 2.

In silico analyses predict this variant to have a benign effect on protein structure and function. CHEK2 Glu64Lys was observed with an allele frequency of 0.1% (6/8600) in European Americans in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, not frequent enough to be considered a common polymorphism.

This mutation destroys a canonical splice donor site and is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing, leading to either an abnormal message that is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or to an abnormal protein product. This mutation has not, to our knowledge, been published in the literature. Most of the cancer risks associated with truncating CHEK2 mutations are gathered from studies of individuals with the common CHEK2 1100delC mutation, and those risks are presented here. CHEK2 1100delC confers a modestly increased female breast cancer risk over the over the general population of 1.7-3.5-fold, or a lifetime risk of approximately 21%-43% (Desrichard 2011, Meijers-Heijboer 2002). A higher risk of breast cancer has been observed in women with the CHEK2 1100delC mutation who have a family history of bilateral breast cancer and women with the CHEK2 1100delC mutation who have been diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to have estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and were observed to have an increased risk for a second breast cancer within 20 years of initial diagnosis (Fletcher 2009, Weischer 2012). CHEK2 1100delC has been associated with familial prostate cancer, conferring up to an 8-fold risk, though the data regarding sporadic prostate cancer are mixed (Seppala 2003, Cybulski 2004). A risk for thyroid cancer of approximately 5% (4.9-fold increased risk) has been reported (Cybulski 2004). The risk for male breast cancer in individuals carrying the common CHEK2 1100delC mutation has been reported to be 10 times higher than the general population risk resulting in a 1.3% lifetime risk (Meijers-Heijboer 2003). CHEK2 mutations have been identified in patients with ovarian cancer and uterine papillary serous carcinoma as well as in families with hereditary breast and colon cancer (Meijers-Heijboer 2003, Pennington 2013, Walsh 2011). In addition, some families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome have been found to have CHEK2 mutations (Bell 1999, Vahteristo 2001).

Case control studies have revealed this variant to be significantly associated with breast cancer (OR= approximately 1.5 for both sporadic and familial cases) (Desrichard 2011, Liu 2012, Han 2013). Furthermore, a large meta-analysis suggested a stronger association of this variant with lobular breast cancer compared to controls (OR&gt;4.1) (Liu 2012). This variant was also observed at a higher frequency in colon cancer cases (OR= 1.4-1.7 sporadic or unselected, and OR=2.0-2.1 familial) (Kilpivaara 2006, Suchy 2010, Han 2013). Finally, the variant is associated with familial prostate cancer (OR=2.1-3.8) (Seppala 2003, Cybulski 2004). Although an earlier study observed an increased risk for non-familial prostate cancer, a large meta-analysis did not confirm this association (Cybulski 2004, Han 2013). Normal CHEK2 is activated in response to DNA damage, preventing further cell division. The resultant Ile157Thr variant protein demonstrates impairment, with loss of activity with respect to CHEK2-mediated DNA damage response, inability to appropriately bind to checkpoint proteins including p53, and inability to autophosphorylate (Falck 2001, Schwarz 2003, Roeb 2012). In addition, Kilpivaara et al. (2004) suggested the Ile157Thr variant protein may dimerize with normal CHEK2 protein and act in a dominant negative fashion. Pedigrees of at least two large families displayed incomplete segregation of this variant with breast cancer, not explaining all disease (Roeb 2012). CHEK2 Ile157Thr was observed with approximate population frequencies of 0.4% in European Americans in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server and 1.4% in 1000 Genomes, but is more common in particular populations, such as Finland and Poland with population frequencies of 5.3% and 4.8% respectively (Desrichard 2011). While the variant is likely a founder, it may also represent a mutational hotspot since multiple distinct haplotype backgrounds exist (Kaufman 2009). This variant is a non-conservative substitution of a neutral non-polar amino acid for a neutral polar one, altering a position that is well conserved throughout evolution and is located in the Forkhead-associated domain. In silico analyses are inconsistent with regard to the effect this variant may have on protein structure and function. In sum, Ile157Thr impairs CHEK2 activity while displaying moderate risk, incomplete segregation with disease, and incomplete penetrance. Based on currently available information, we consider CHEK2 Ile157Thr to be a variant,expected pathogenic.

The normal sequence, with the bases that are deleted in brackets, is TAGA{AGA}TCAC. This in frame deletion in exon 4 occurs in a region which is highly conserved through mammals and is located in the FHA domain (UniProt). This variant was observed in one woman with a personal and family history of breast cancer, one woman with a personal history of breast cancer and family history suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and was absent from unaffected controls (Sodha 2002, Desrichard 2011). Functional studies led to the conclusion that CHEK2 Glu161del was likely pathogenic based on no kinase activity, reduced protein expression and stability, and reduced activation in response to DNA damage (Sodha 2006, Desrichard 2011). Based on currently available information, we consider CHEK2 Glu161del to be an expected pathogenic variant. While the possibility that this variant is benign cannot be excluded, it is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation. A pathogenic mutation in the CHEK2 gene is consistent with an increased risk for certain cancers, including breast, colon, prostate, and others. Most of the studies of cancer risk associated with CHEK2 mutations have analyzed two common mutations, 1100delC and Ile157Thr, and it is primarily those risks which are presented here. Breast Cancer: CHEK2 mutations are known to confer an increased risk of breast cancer. The truncating mutation CHEK2 1100delC was overrepresented among breast cancer cases (OR= 2.2 -3.2 sporadic or unselected cases and 3.1-4.2 familial) (Cybulski 2004, The CHEK2 Breast Cancer Consortium 2004). The missense mutation Ile157Thr was also overrepresented in these populations, but with lower odds ratios (OR =1.4 sporadic and 1.8 familial) (Cybulski 2004, Liu 2012, Han 2013). In general, truncating mutations are thought to confer a higher breast cancer risk than missense mutations, though in silico predictions suggest select severe missense mutations may have a similar risk (Le Calvez-Kelm 2011). Among women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, CHEK21100delC heterozygosity is associated with a 3.5-fold risk of a second breast cancer (Wesscher 2012). Although two studies found up to a 4- to 10-fold increased risk for male breast cancer for families with CHEK2 1100delC, other groups have not observed as high a frequency of this mutation among male breast cancer cases (Meijers-Heijboer 2002, Ohayon 2004, Neuhausen 2004, Falchetti 2008, Wasielewski 2009). Colon Cancer: While truncating mutations are not consistently associated with colon cancer, Ile157Thr has been significantly associated with both sporadic and familial colon cancer (OR= 1.4-1.7 sporadic and 2.0-2.1 familial) (Cybulski 2004, Kilpivaara 2006, Suchy 2010, Liu 2012, Han 2013). Prostate Cancer: CHEK2 mutations have been found to be associated with familial prostate cancer, (OR=2.1-3.8 for Ile157Thr, with potentially higher OR for 1100delC) and weakly or not at all with sporadic prostate cancer (OR=1.6-2.1 in some studies, while others show no association) (Seppala 2003, Dong 2003, Cybulski 2004). Other Cancers: CHEK2 variants have been observed in individuals with endometrial cancer, and one study suggests a slightly increased risk (Einarsdóttir 2007, Pennington 2013). Cybulski et al. (2004) noted a significant association with thyroid cancer for one splicing mutation, IVS2+1G&gt;A (OR= 4.9) but this association was not observed for other truncating or missense mutations.

This variant was observed in an individual with sporadic prostate cancer (Dong 2003) and in familial breast cancer patients (Roeb 2012, Dufault 2004). In a yeast-based functional assay, CHEK2 Gly167Arg had no response to DNA damage and was defined as damaging, however it was observed in the compound heterozygous state and it was not possible to determine which allele(s) were damaging (Roeb 2012). CHEK2 Gly167Arg was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Since Glycine and Arginine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. CHEK2 Gly167Arg alters a position that is highly conserved across species and is located within the FHA domain (UniProt). Multiple in silico analyses predict that this variant is probably damaging to protein structure and function.

Compared with breast cancer patients without CHEK2 1100delC, women who carried the mutation had higher rates of a second breast cancer, particularly if the first was estrogen-receptor positive (OR=2.8 and 3.5, respectively) (Weischer 2012). Although two studies found up to a 4- to 10-fold increased risk for male breast cancer for families with CHEK2 1100delC, other groups have not observed as high a frequency of this mutation among male breast cancer cases (Meijers-Heijboer 2002, Ohayon 2004, Neuhausen 2004, Falchetti 2008, Wasielewski 2009).

Roeb et al. 2012 classified CHEK2 Glu239Lys as an intermediate variant in a CHEK2-mediated DNA damage response functional assay while Wu et al. 2006 came to similar conclusions reporting that this variant resulted in partially reduced kinase activity after the induction of DNA damage. CHEK2 Glu239Lys was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Since Glutamic Acid and Lysine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. CHEK2 Glu239Lys alters a position that is conserved across species and is located in a protein kinase domain (Robe 2012). In silico analyses are inconsistent regarding the effect this variant may have on protein structure and function. Based on currently available information, it is unclear whether CHEK2 Glu239Lys is a pathogenic mutation or a benign variant. The variant is found in HEREDICANCER,BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000186151","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Nov 19 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007194.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(CHEK2):c.715G>A (p.Glu239Lys)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000026130","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Aug 26 2014 07:00:56:843AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000186151","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Nov 19 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007194.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(CHEK2):c.847-17T>C","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000167690","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Apr  2 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in HEREDICANCER,BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000185895","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Aug 12 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_007194.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(CHEK2):c.917G>C (p.Gly306Ala)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000149942","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Jun  3 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"This variant is denoted CHEK2 c.917G&gt;C at the cDNA level, p.Gly306Ala (G306A) at the protein level, and results in the change of a Glycine to an Alanine (GGG&gt;GCG) in exon 9. This variant was observed in invidiously with familial breast cancer and was shown to cause loss of proper DNA damage response in a yeast-based assay (Le Calvez-Kelm 2011, Roeb 2012). CHEK2 Gly306Ala was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant is a non-conservative substitution in which a neutral non-polar amino acid is replaced with a negative polar one, altering a position that is well conserved throughout evolution and is located in the kinase domain (Roeb 2012). Multiple in silico algorithms predict that this variant may be damaging to protein structure and function. Based on the currently available information, we consider CHEK2 Gly306Ala to be a variant, expected pathogenic. While the possibility that this variant is benign cannot be excluded, it is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation. Pathogenic missense mutations in this gene have been estimated to increase the risk of female breast cancer 1.6-fold over the general population resulting in a lifetime risk of approximately 20% (Desrichard 2011). Prostate cancer risk has been reported to be increased 1.5-fold over the general population resulting in a 24% lifetime risk (Seppala 2003). A higher risk of breast cancer has been observed in women with a CHEK2 mutation (the common 1100delC) who have a family history of bilateral breast cancer, and women with the same mutation who had been diagnosed with breast cancer were more likely to have estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer and were observed to have an increased risk for a second breast cancer within 20 years of initial diagnosis (Fletcher 2009, Weischer 2012). CHEK2 mutations have been found to be associated with familial and sporadic prostate cancer, with a stronger association with familial cases (Seppala 2003, Dong 2003). A risk for thyroid cancer of approximately 5% (4.9-fold increased risk) has been reported (Cybulski 2004). CHEK2 missense mutations have been associated with a 2-fold increase in colon cancer risk resulting in an 8%-10% lifetime risk and have been identified in patients with kidney cancer, thyroid cancer, and uterine papillary serous carcinoma (Cybulski 2004, Pennington 2013).

The T590M variant in the COL6A2 gene has been reported previously in an individual with Bethlem myopathy who had disorganized collagen VI in fibroblasts but normal muscle biopsy IHC staining. No other mutations were reported in this individual and familial segregation analysis and functional studies were not performed (Hicks et al., 2008). The T590M variant was also reported in an individual with myosclerosis myopathy who also had another missense change in the COL6A2 gene, although phase was not specified (Butterfield et al., 2013). The T590M variant was observed at a frequency of 0.24%, 21/8594 alleles, in individuals of European ancestry by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project but was not present in the homozygous state in any individuals within this population. The T590M variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position in the triple helical region that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. As an alternate mechanism, a splice predictor model indicates that this sequence change may have a mild effect on gene splicing. A missense mutation in a nearby residue (E600K) has been reported in association with collagen VI myopathy, supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. The T590M variant is a good candidate for a disease-causing mutation, however the possibility it may be a rare benign variant cannot be excluded.

reported in 1 individual with late onset progressive distal myopathy (without cardiomyopathy; Reilich 2010) and 1 individual with DCM (Pilotto 2006). In addition, one study detected this variant in 8 individuals with HCM though it should be noted that this is an unpublished conference abstract only (Sriram 2007). The variant was absent from over 2,000 control chromosomes across these studies (Pilotto 2006; Sriram 2007). Other studies have shown that the Gly154Ser variant impacts normal protein function (Raju 2013). However, this in vitro assay may not accurately represent biological function. This variant has been identified by our laboratory in 3 individuals with HCM, 2 of whom carry a second, potentially pathogenic variant, 2 individuals with DCM, 1 of whom carries a disease causing variant and 1 individual with right ventricle dilation and ventricular tachycardia. This variant has been detected in 0.1% (9/8594) of European American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs150516929). It should be noted that it is unclear whether a variant can cause hypertrophic as well as dilated cardiomyopathy as these diseases have different molecular mechanisms. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Gly154Ser variant may not impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to rule out pathogenicity. In summary, additional information is needed to establish the clinical significance of this variant."},{"scv":"SCV000058409","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Aug  7 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_001885.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(CSRP3):c.10T>C (p.Trp4Arg)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000029539","source":"OMIM","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Sep 15 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000197501","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Jul 26 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"ADD TO SUMMARY:PLEASE NOTE: This individual carries a likely benign variant in the CSRP3 gene (Trp4Arg). This variant is unlikely to cause disease on its own, but is supported by data suggesting that it may have a contributory role. Please see comments section for details.ADD TO COMMENTS:Trp4Arg in exon 2 of CSRP3: This variant has been identified in several control populations (Bos 2006, Newman 2005, Geier 2008, dbSNP rs45550635) and in 0.5% (46/8586) of European American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS). This variant has also been reported in multiple cases of HCM and DCM (Knšll 2002, Mohapatra 2003, Newman 2005, Bos 2006, Geier 2008).  Mouse models with this variant exhibit features of HCM late in life (Knšll 2010) but no human studies are available to date to confirm an effect in humans. In summary, mouse studies suggest that this variant may play a role in disease, but given that its frequency in the general population is much higher than the population prevalence of HCM (1/500 individuals), a primary disease causing is role unlikely."}],"transcript":"NM_003476.4","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(CSRP3):c.131T>C (p.Leu44Pro)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000029541","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Apr  7 2009 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000061432","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 14 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The Leu44Pro variant in CSRP3 has been identified in 1 individual with HCM, was absent from 1000 control chromosomes and segregated with disease in 2 definitively and 1 possibly affected relatives as well as one obligate carrier with unknown disease status (Geier 2003; Geier 2008).

This variant has also been identified in 1/8600 European American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs62636492). This could represent a presymptomatic individual and the overall low population frequency supports pathogenicity. In vitro studies showed disruption of the desmin filament assembly, although in vitro assays do not always accurately reflect biological function (Taylor 2007). Arginine (Arg) at position 350 is highly conserved evolution and computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that this variant may impact the protein (the accuracy of these tools is unknown). Finally, another variant at this position (Arg350Pro) has been reported as a pathogenic variant in individuals with conduction system disease, and cardiac and skeletal myopathy (BŠr 2005, Walter 2007, Levin 2010).

Glutamic acid (Glu) at position 102 is not conserved in mammals or evolutionarily distant species and 1 mammal (pika) carries a Lysine (Lys) at this position, raising the possibility that this change may be tolerated. Additional computational prediction tools also suggest that the p.Glu102Lys variant may not impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to rule out pathogenicity. In summary, in the presence of conflicting data, the clinical significance of the p.Glu102Lys variant is uncertain."},{"scv":"SCV000190167","source":"CSER_CC_NCGL","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Jun  1 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_004949.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(DSC2):c.631-2A>G","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000038623","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Sep  3 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000197728","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Aug  8 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The 631-2A&gt;G variant in DSC2 has been reported in 1 Caucasian individual with ARVC (Heuser 2006).

Of note, this variant has been published by several studies (http://arvcdatabase.info/), though the data provided by these studies is uninformative."}],"transcript":"NM_004415.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(DSP):c.913A>T (p.Ile305Phe)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000052338","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000188753","source":"Blueprint Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Oct 24 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000061785","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Oct 12 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Ile305Phe in exon 7 of DSP: This variant is classified as benign based on its high frequency in the general population (rs17604693, MAF &gt;3%)."}],"transcript":"NM_004415.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(DSP):c.913A>T (p.Ile305Phe)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000052338","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000061785","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Oct 12 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Ile305Phe in exon 7 of DSP: This variant is classified as benign based on its high frequency in the general population (rs17604693, MAF &gt;3%)."}],"transcript":"NM_004415.2","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(DTNA):c.1095-8T>C","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000063378","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Oct 16 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"1086-8T&gt;C in intron 12A of DTNA: This variant is not expected to have clinical significance because it has been identified in 0.47% (33/7020) of European American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs41274310).  1086-8T&gt;C in intron 12A of DTNA (rs41274310; allele frequency = 0.47%, 33/7020) **"},{"scv":"SCV000168281","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Apr 16 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in CARDIOMYOPATHY panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_001390.4","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(DTNA):c.1822+8G>A","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000052339","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000063365","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jul 31 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"4.2% (185/4406) of Afr Amer chrom from ESP"}],"transcript":"NM_001390.4","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(DTNA):c.2081+14G>A","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000052340","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000063369","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jul  2 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_001390.4","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(DTNA):c.210G>A (p.Leu70=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000052341","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000063370","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Feb  2 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Leu70Leu in exon 5 of DTNA: This variant is classified as benign based on its high frequency in the general population (dbSNP rs117571555; NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS)."},{"scv":"SCV000168276","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Mar 10 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in CARDIOMYOPATHY panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_001390.4","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(DTNA):c.210G>A (p.Leu70=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000052341","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000168276","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Mar 10 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in CARDIOMYOPATHY panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_001390.4","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(DYNC1H1):c.12087C>A (p.His4029Gln)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000150995","source":"Genetic Services Laboratory, University of Chicago","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"","comments":"Likely benign based on allele frequency in 1000 Genomes Project or ESP global frequency and its presence in a patient with a rare or unrelated disease phenotype.

In addition, this variant has been identified as a germline mutation in at least 14 unrelated individuals with NSCLC (including never smokers; Bell 2005, Prudkin 2009, Girard 2010, Tibaldi 2011, Oxnard 2012, Thomas 2013, Gazdar 2014, Yu 2014) and segregated with lung cancer and pulmonary disease in at least 4 affected individuals from 3 families (Bell 2005, Gazdar 2012, Yu 2014).

This variant has been identified by our laboratory in one family; two family members that are reportedly minimally affected with some clinical features of Marfan syndrome carry this variant. Valine (Val) at amino acid position 2234 is not completely conserved in other mammals or distantly related species (cow, dog, elephant, chicken and frog carry an alanine; opossum carries an isoleucine; fish carries a threonine). Furthermore, this variant has been reported in dbSNP (rs112084407) with a minor allele frequency of 0.002. Collectively, these data reduce the likelihood that this change is pathogenic.

The S174C variant was not observed at any significant frequency in approximately 5700 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The S174C variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in most mammals; Cysteine is tolerated at this position in other species.

This mutation is a nonconservative substitution of a neutral, polar Threonine with a non-polar Methionine at a residue that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this mutation is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Another mutation affecting this codon (T314P) has been associated with cobblestone lissencephaly, and mutations in nearby residues (R312C, P315S) cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy or muscle-eye-brain disease, underscoring the functional importance of this region of the protein.

Although rare, mutations in the FKTN gene have been reported in association with isolated DCM (Murakami T et al., 2006). To date, all individuals with apparently isolated DCM caused by mutations in the FKTN gene have been compound heterozygous for a missense mutation and a 3kb retrotransposal insertion in the 3'UTR. The 3kb retrotransposal insertion is common in individuals of Japanese ancestry (Arimura T et al., 2009; Murakami T et al., 2006). The T433A variant in the FKTN gene has not been reported as a disease-causing mutation or as a benign polymorphism to our knowledge. T433A is a non-conservative amino acid substitution as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties and is more likely to impact secondary structure. However, the T433 residue is not well conserved across species. In silico algorithms are not consistent in their predictions, but at least two concur T433A is benign to the protein structure/function. Additionally, missense mutations in nearby residues have not been reported in association with cardiomyopathy, indicating this region of the protein may tolerate change. The NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project identified the T433A variant with a frequency of 0.3%, 23/8600 alleles, in individuals of European ancestry. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic mutation or a rare benign variant.

In silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function.

This variant has also been seen in 0.08% (7/8598) European American chromosomes from a broad population screened by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu; dbSNP rs12720457). In addition, studies have shown that the Lys393Asn variant does not impact protein function (Shamgar 2006). However, these in vitro assays may not accurately represent biological function. Furthermore, this amino acid is not conserved across species, including mammals. Of note, cat has a asparagine (Asn; this variant) at this position despite high nearby amino acid conservation. In addition, computational analyses (PolyPhen2, SIFT, AlignGVGD) do not suggest a high likelihood of impact to the protein.

Although a mouse model showed prolonged-QT intervals with homozygosity of the variant (Nishio 2009), clinical disease was not documented. Follow-up studies showed that function of the Val207Met KCNQ1 protein is comparable to wild-type (Eldstrom 2010). In addition, the variant has subsequently been observed in 0.3% (14/4402) of African American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project as well as 1.7% (3/176) of individuals of Yoruba descent (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs75813654).

However, T196S results in a conservative amino acid substitution of one non-polar amino acid for another, and the T196S residue is only conserved to frog. Furthermore, mutations in nearby residues have not been reported, indicating this region of the protein may be tolerant of change.Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic mutation or a rare benign variant. This result cannot be interpreted for diagnosis or used for family member screening at this time. Clinical correlation with this test result is recommended. The variant is found in HCM,DCM-CRDM,CARDIOMYOPATHY panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_001122606.1","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(LAMP2):c.591G>A (p.Val197=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000061080","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Nov 14 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Val197Val in exon 5 of LAMP2: This variant is not expected to have clinical significance because it does not alter an amino acid residue and is not located within the splice consensus sequence.

Using an in vitro system, Marks et al demonstrated the Lys57Asn variant produced a gain-of-function resulting in increased downstream ERK phosphorylation. Please note, this in vitro system may not accurately represent biological function. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong evidence for or against an impact to the protein. The Lys57Gln variant was not identified in either parent of this proband, and thus occurred de novo. Given the de novo occurrence of this variant in a proband with clinical features of Noonan syndrome, this variant is highly likely to be pathogenic. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM)."},{"scv":"SCV000207949","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Dec 10 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"A missense change was identified in the MAP2K1 gene. To our knowledge, this variant has neither been published as a mutation, nor has it been reported as a benign polymorphism. The K57Q missense change is considered to be a non-conservative amino acid substitution, as a positively charged residue (Lys) is replaced by a neutral residue (Gln) at a position in the protein that is highly conserved across species and within related proteins. Furthermore, missense changes in nearby codons (F53S and T55P) have previously been reported in association with cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome and Costello syndrome, respectively, which are other disorders of the RAS/MAPK pathway (Rodriguez - Viciana et al., 2006; Nava et al., 2007).

previously identified in a female with a history of developmental regression and fulfilled the criteria for Rett syndrome (Zvereff et al., 2012). Family history was unknown and the authors reported the substitution as a variant of unknown significance because in-silico algorithms were not consistent in their predictions of whether V481M was pathogenic. NHLBI Exome Variant Project has not identified V481M in approximately 6,000 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The amino acid substitution is conservative as both Valine and Methionine are uncharged, non-polar amino acid residues. V481M alters a highly conserved position in the MECP2 protein. While several in-silico algorithms predict it may be damaging to the structure/function of the protein, one model predicts it may be benign.

Additionally, a duplication of two Alanine residues in this region of the protein has been reported as a benign polymorphism because it was identified in a female with Rett syndrome and her unaffected mother in one family and did not co-segregate with intellectual disability in another family (Evans et al., 2005; Quenard et al., 2006). However, other variations in the number of Alanine or Glycine repeats in this region of the protein were found in approximately 1% of females with intellectual disability but a significantly smaller percentage of controls, so the authors suggested these variants may be associated with an increased risk for intellectual disability (Harvey et al., 2007).

Missense mutations in nearby residues (T228S and G237V) have been reported in association with Rett syndrome , supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. However, the A234G variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is not conserved across species, and Glycine is seen at this position in other mammals.

This variant has been reported with uncertain significance most recently from a multifactorial likelihood analysis giving the variant a 0.080 posterior probability of pathogenicity (Thompson 2013). This variant was also reported with uncertain signficance in an individual with cancer of the sigmoid colon (Limburg 2011). IHC studies showed the presence of MMR protein expression in this patient. A case study of a compound heterozygote for two MLH1 variants (one being Ala441Thr) and a BRCA1 mutation has been described (Hackman 1997, Borg 2000). Additionally, microsatellite DNA mutation frequency was estimated and suggested a constitutional mutator phenotype (Hackman 1997). Due to tumor studies and personal and family history information, the authors were not able to exclude the Ala441Thr variant from significance in tumor development, even in the presence of a BRCA1 mutation (Borg 2000). Functional studies by Takahashi et al (2007) using yeast and in vitro mismatch repair assays showed ~70% MMR activity and relative MLH1 expression of 25-75% for this variant. MLH1 Ala441Thr was not observed at significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, suggesting it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant is a non-conservative substitution of a neutral non-polar amino acid for a neutral polar one, altering a position that is well conserved throughout evolution and that tolerates a MLH1 Ala441Thr change in one mammal. This variant is located in the region of interaction with EXO1 (UniProt). In silico analyses predict this variant to have a benign effect on protein structure and function.

The International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours (InSiGHT) classifies this variant as Class 2, likely not pathogenic (Thompson 2014). While this variant has been reported in families with Lynch syndrome-associated cancers (Cravo 2002, Barnetson 2008, PÃ©rez-Cabornero 2013), it has also been published as neutral based on functional studies in which in vitro mismatch repair activity was similar to wild type (Takahashi 2007), and RNA studies where no effect on splicing was observed (Tournier 2008). However, Xie et al. (2010) reported that MLH1 Leu607His caused loss of FANCJ binding to MLH1, which recent studies suggest may affect DNA damage response even in the context of a microsatellite stable phenotype (Guillemette 2014).MLH1 Leu607His was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. This variant is a non-conservative substitution in which a neutral non-polar amino acid is replaced with a positive polar one, altering a position that is well conserved throughout evolution and is located within the exonuclease 1 binding domain (UniProt). Multiple in silico algorithms predict that this variant may be damaging to protein structure and function. Despite some evidence suggesting neutrality, we consider MLH1 Leu607His to be a variant of unknown significance. The variant is found in COLO-HEREDIC,BR-OV-HEREDIC,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000183756","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jan 10 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000249.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MLH1):c.1820T>A (p.Leu607His)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000106367","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Multifactorial likelihood analysis posterior probability 0.001-0.049"},{"scv":"SCV000183756","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jan 10 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000249.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MLH1):c.1852A>G (p.Lys618Glu)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000106377","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Insufficient evidence"},{"scv":"SCV000187516","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Nov 14 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000170298","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Apr  4 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000249.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MLH1):c.1852A>G (p.Lys618Glu)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000106377","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Insufficient evidence"},{"scv":"SCV000170298","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Apr  4 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000249.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MLH1):c.1852_1853delAAinsGC (p.Lys618Ala)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000038903","source":"OMIM","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Feb  5 2015 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000185816","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Oct 16 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000043327","source":"Biesecker Laboratory -

MLH1 Asn64Ser has been observed in multiple affected individuals and families meeting clinical diagnostic criteria for Lynch syndrome (Winjen 1997, Spaepen 2006, Hardt 2011). MLH1 Asn64Ser has been reported to co-segregate with disease and in association with microsatellite instability (Spaepen 2006). Multiple functional assays have demonstrated that MLH1 Asn64Ser has a deleterious effect on protein function with respect to mutator effect, expression, in vitro MMR activity, and reduced interaction with PMS2 (Ellison 2004, Plotz 2006, Wanat 2007, Hardt 2011). Specifically, Takahashi et al. (2007) using yeast and in vitro mismatch repair functional assays showed ~37% MMR activity but relative MLH1 Asn64Ser expression of &gt;75% compared to the wild type. The International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours Incorporated (InSiGHT) classifies this variant as likely pathogenic (Thompson 2014).

This variant has not, to our knowledge, been published in the literature as either a mutation or a benign polymorphism. MLH1 Gly738Glu was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Since Glycine and Glutamic Acid differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. MLH1 Gly738Glu alters a position that is moderately conserved across species and is located in the Pms1p-interaction domain (Pang 1997).

This mutation destroys a canonical splice donor site and is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing, leading to either an abnormal message that is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or to an abnormal protein product. This mutation has been reported in a Chinese cohort meeting clinical criteria for Lynch syndrome (Sheng 2008). We consider this mutation to be pathogenic and is indicative of Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant condition that increases ones risk to develop colorectal and endometrial cancer primarily, as well as other types of cancer such as ovarian, gastric, small bowel, urinary tract and biliary tract. Colon and endometrial cancer are the predominant MLH1-associated cancers that unaffected mutation carriers are at risk to develop. Historically, the lifetime risk for colon cancer has been estimated to be 22 to 80% for both male and female MLH1 mutation carriers while the lifetime risk for endometrial cancer has been estimated to be 31 to 54% in female mutation carriers (Kohlmann 2012, Quehenberger 2005, Vasen 1996). Two recent large studies have suggested that some cancers risks for MLH1 mutation carriers may not be as high as previously thought; Dowty et al. (2013) and Bonadona et al. (2011) have estimated a 34 to 41% risk of colon cancer for both men and women by the age of 70, an 18-54% risk for endometrial cancer, and a 13 to 20% risk for ovarian cancer. Other cancer risks affecting both male and female MLH1 mutation carriers include a 6 to 20% risk for gastric cancer, a 1 to 3% risk for a urinary tract cancer and a 2% risk for a biliary tract cancer (Dowty 2013, Bonadona 2011). Lynch syndrome patients who have been diagnosed with colon or endometrial cancers have been reported to have an increased risk for a second LS-associated cancer during their lifetime (Palomaki 2009, Win 2013). Some individuals with MLH1 mutations will be identified as having a variant of Lynch syndrome, characterized by the development of rare LS-associated tumors (both benign and malignant) in addition to the common LS-associated tumors. The Muir-Torre variant is associated with the development of sebaceous neoplasms and keratoacanthomas of the skin while the Turcot variant is associated with the development of glioblastomas. Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMR-D) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by two mutations (one affecting each allele) of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM). This condition is characterized by an increased risk for certain cancers in children including hematologic malignancies, rhabdomyosarcoma, brain tumors, early onset gastrointestinal tumors as well as dermatological manifestations such as café-au-lait macules (Durno 2010, Wimmer 2010). If an MLH1 mutation carrier’s partner is also heterozygous for a MLH1 mutation, the risk to have a child with CMMR-D is 25% for each pregnancy. The variant is found in HEREDICANCER panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000249.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(MLH1):c.453G>A (p.Thr151=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000106723","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"G&gt;non-G at last base of exon with first 6 bases of the intron not GTRRGT"},{"scv":"SCV000187566","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Apr 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000249.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MLH1):c.474C>T (p.Asn158=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000106739","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Co-occurrence with a pathogenic mutation, not demonstrating CMMRD phenotype &amp; MAF 0.01-1%.

Based on the current evidence, we consider this mutation to be pathogenic. and is indicative of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to colorectal and endometrial cancer as well as other cancers. The predominant MLH1-related cancer risks for individuals who have not been diagnosed with cancer have been estimated as 22%-80% lifetime risk for colorectal cancer, 31%-54% lifetime risk for endometrial cancer, and 4-20% risk for ovarian cancer (Bonadona 2011, Kohlmann 2012, Quehenberger 2005, Vasen 1996). The most recent large study which accounted for ascertainment bias estimated the risks by age 70 for MLH1 mutation carriers to be 41% for colorectal cancer, 54% for endometrial cancer, 20% for ovarian cancer, 6% risk for gastric cancer, and less than 2% risk for biliary tract, small bowel, and urothelium cancers (Bonadona 2011). A recent prospective study reported an increased risk for breast cancer and pancreatic cancer in individuals with Lynch syndrome (Win 2012). Some individuals with Lynch syndrome have sebaceous neoplasms of the skin (Muir Torre variant) or glioblastomas (Turcot variant). Individuals with Lynch syndrome who have been diagnosed with colon or endometrial cancers have an increased risk for a second primary diagnosis of a Lynch syndrome-associated cancer (Palomaki 2009, Win 2013).

MRE11A Arg305Trp was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, suggesting it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant is a non-conservative substitution in which a positive polar amino acid is replaced with a neutral non-polar one, altering a position that is fully conserved throughout evolution and is located in the PDE motif V (Heikkinen 2003). Multiple in silico algorithms predict that this variant may be damaging to protein structure and function. Mutations in the MRE11A (also known as MRE11) gene have recently been associated with breast and ovarian cancer risk (Bartkova 2008, Heikkinen 2003, Walsh 2011). Heikkinen et al. (2003) screened women diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer from 151 Finnish breast and/or ovarian cancer families for mutations in the MRE11A gene. In this series, one likely pathogenic mutation was identified in a woman diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 37 and a reported family history of cervical and uterine cancers. This MRE11A mutation was absent from 1000 controls. The authors noted that MRE11A Arg305Trp is located at the end of the functional domain, where it may be involved in causing structural instability leading to an increased susceptibility to cancer. Thus, Heikkinen et al. consider MRE11A Arg305Trp to be a likely pathogenic mutation. Bartkova et al. (2008) screened 1000 breast tumor samples for reduced expression of the protein products of the MRE11A, RAD50, and NBS1 genes. Tumors from 8 patients showed reduced or no expression of these proteins, and two germline MRE11A mutations were identified in this group. Walsh et al. (2011) also identified a MRE11A mutation in 1/360 patients with ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer unselected for family history. Two mutations (one in each copy of the gene) in the MRE11A gene cause a rare ataxia telangiectasia-like disorder (A-TLD). When two individuals with known pathogenic MRE11A mutations have children, the risk of A-TLD is 25% with each pregnancy. The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000187182","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Mar 20 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_005591.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.1045C>G (p.Pro349Ala)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000107018","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Insufficient evidence"},{"scv":"SCV000172803","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Mar 13 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.1168C>T (p.Leu390Phe)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043339","source":"Biesecker Laboratory - ClinSeq Project, NHGRI","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jul 13 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000110269","source":"Emory Genetics Laboratory","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Feb 19 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000107066","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Multifactorial likelihood analysis posterior probability &lt;0.001"},{"scv":"SCV000172768","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Oct 12 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000149404","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Sep 12 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.1168C>T (p.Leu390Phe)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043339","source":"Biesecker Laboratory - ClinSeq Project, NHGRI","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jul 13 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000107066","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Multifactorial likelihood analysis posterior probability &lt;0.001"}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.1168C>T (p.Leu390Phe)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043339","source":"Biesecker Laboratory - ClinSeq Project, NHGRI","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jul 13 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000172768","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Oct 12 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.1168C>T (p.Leu390Phe)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000043339","source":"Biesecker Laboratory - ClinSeq Project, NHGRI","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jul 13 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000149404","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Sep 12 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.1277-8T>C","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000110270","source":"Emory Genetics Laboratory","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jul  1 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000166261","source":"Invitae","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Jun 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The interpretation for this sequence variant was made by Invitae based on the ACMG guidelines."},{"scv":"SCV000170335","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Nov 22 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,COLO-HEREDIC panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.1277-8T>C","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000110270","source":"Emory Genetics Laboratory","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jul  1 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000170335","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Nov 22 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,COLO-HEREDIC panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.1387-8G>T","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000052906","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000170337","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Dec 12 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000107164","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Intronic substitution with no effect on splicing, treated with NMD inhibitor.

This variant has been reported in individuals with colorectal cancer and Lynch syndrome, and was absent from healthy controls (Otway 2000, Parc 2003, Barnetson 2006, Barnetson 2008, Cyr 2012). While some functional studies have shown that MSH2 c.1A&gt;C has no effect on MSH6 or MSH3 interaction or heterodimer stability in vitro, other in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated reduced DNA and adenosine nucleotide binding affinity, reduced mismatch-induced ATPase activity, and impaired mismatch repair activity associated with this variant (Barnetson 2006, Barnetson 2008, Cyr 2012). Based on the currently available information, we consider MSH2 c.1A&gt;C to be a variant, expected pathogenic.While the possibility that this variant is benign cannot be excluded, it is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation. A pathogenic mutation in this gene is indicative of Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant condition that increases ones risk to develop colorectal and endometrial cancer primarily, as well as other types of cancer such as ovarian, gastric, small bowel, urinary tract and biliary tract. Colon and endometrial cancer are the predominant MSH2-associated cancers that unaffected mutation carriers are at risk to develop. Historically, the lifetime risk for colon cancer has been estimated to be 22 to 80% for both male and female MSH2 mutation carriers while the lifetime risk for endometrial cancer has been estimated to be 31 to 61% in female mutation carriers (Kohlmann 2012, Quehenberger 2005, Vasen 1996). Two recent large studies have suggested that some cancers risks for MSH2 mutation carriers may not be as high as previously thought. Dowty et al. (2013) and Bonadona et al. (2011) have estimated a 37 to 48% risk of colon cancer for both men and women, a 21 to 30% risk for endometrial cancer, and a 10 to 24% risk for ovarian cancer. Other cancer risks affecting both male and female MSH2 mutation carriers include a 0.2 to 9% risk for gastric cancer, a 1% risk for small bowel cancer, and an 8 to 10% risk for urinary tract cancers (Dowty 2013, Bonadona 2011). Lynch syndrome patients who have been diagnosed with colon or endometrial cancers have been reported to have an increased risk for a second LS-associated cancer during their lifetime (Palomaki 2009, Win 2013). Some individuals with MSH2 mutations will be identified as having a variant of Lynch syndrome, characterized by the development of rare LS-associated tumors (both benign and malignant) in addition to the common LS-associated cancers. The Muir-Torre variant is associated with the development of sebaceous neoplasms and keratoacanthomas of the skin while the Turcot variant is associated with the development of glioblastomas. Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMR-D) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by two mutations (one affecting each allele) of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM). This condition is characterized by an increased risk for certain cancers in children including hematologic malignancies, rhabdomyosarcoma, brain tumors, early onset gastrointestinal tumors as well as dermatological manifestations such as cafe-au-lait macules (Durno 2010, Wimmer 2010). If an MSH2 mutation carrier's partner is also heterozygous for a MSH2 mutation, the risk to have a child with CMMR-D is 25% for each pregnancy.

This condition is characterized by an increased risk for certain cancers in children including hematologic malignancies, rhabdomyosarcoma, brain tumors, early onset gastrointestinal tumors as well as dermatological manifestations such as cafe-au-lait macules (Durno 2010, Wimmer 2010). If an MSH2 mutation carrier's partner is also heterozygous for a MSH2 mutation, the risk to have a child with CMMR-D is 25% for each pregnancy. The variant is found in ENDOM-HEREDIC,BR-OV-HEREDIC,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.2005+1G>A","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000107361","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Interrupts canonical donor splice site"},{"scv":"SCV000110273","source":"Emory Genetics Laboratory","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Nov 13 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.2006-5T>A","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000021999","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Mar 26 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000107377","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Insufficient evidence: effect of of transcript with in-frame insertion unknown."}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.2154A>G (p.Gln718=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000107441","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Synonymous substitution with no effect on splicing tested with NMD inhibitor.

The normal sequence, with the bases that are deleted in brackets, is TCTC{CTC}ATCC. This in frame deletion in exon 3 occurs in a region that is well conserved and is located in the connector domain (Lutzen 2008). MSH2 Leu191del has been observed in families meeting Amsterdam criteria for Lynch syndrome and characterized as likely pathogenic on the basis of evolutionary conservation, physicochemical properties of amino acid substitution and absence of MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression in tumors (Arnold 2009, Sjursen 2010). MSH2 Leu191del has been characterized by The International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours Incorporated (InSiGHT) as pathogenic (class 5) on the basis of a multifactorial algorithm assessing computational models, tumor characteristics, and segregation studies (Thompson 2013). Based on the currently available information, we consider MSH2 Leu191del to be a variant, expected pathogenic.While the possibility that this variant is benign cannot be excluded, it is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation. A pathogenic mutation in this gene is indicative of Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant condition that increases ones risk to develop colorectal and endometrial cancer primarily, as well as other types of cancer such as ovarian, gastric, small bowel, urinary tract and biliary tract. Colon and endometrial cancer are the predominant MSH2-associated cancers that unaffected mutation carriers are at risk to develop. Historically, the lifetime risk for colon cancer has been estimated to be 22 to 80% for both male and female MSH2 mutation carriers while the lifetime risk for endometrial cancer has been estimated to be 31 to 61% in female mutation carriers (Kohlmann 2012, Quehenberger 2005, Vasen 1996). Two recent large studies have suggested that some cancers risks for MSH2 mutation carriers may not be as high as previously thought. Dowty et al. (2013) and Bonadona et al. (2011) have estimated a 37 to 48% risk of colon cancer for both men and women, a 21 to 30% risk for endometrial cancer, and a 10 to 24% risk for ovarian cancer. Other cancer risks affecting both male and female MSH2 mutation carriers include a 0.2 to 9% risk for gastric cancer, a 1% risk for small bowel cancer, and an 8 to 10% risk for urinary tract cancers (Dowty 2013, Bonadona 2011). Lynch syndrome patients who have been diagnosed with colon or endometrial cancers have been reported to have an increased risk for a second LS-associated cancer during their lifetime (Palomaki 2009, Win 2013). Some individuals with MSH2 mutations will be identified as having a variant of Lynch syndrome, characterized by the development of rare LS-associated tumors (both benign and malignant) in addition to the common LS-associated cancers. The Muir-Torre variant is associated with the development of sebaceous neoplasms and keratoacanthomas of the skin while the Turcot variant is associated with the development of glioblastomas. Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMR-D) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by two mutations (one affecting each allele) of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM). This condition is characterized by an increased risk for certain cancers in children including hematologic malignancies, rhabdomyosarcoma, brain tumors, early onset gastrointestinal tumors as well as dermatological manifestations such as cafe-au-lait macules (Durno 2010, Wimmer 2010). If an MSH2 mutation carrier's partner is also heterozygous for a MSH2 mutation, the risk to have a child with CMMR-D is 25% for each pregnancy. The variant is found in COLYNCH-HEREDIC panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.6G>T (p.Ala2=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000107720","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Multifactorial likelihood analysis posterior probability 0.001-0.049"},{"scv":"SCV000211250","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jul 21 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in HEREDICANCER,BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000166285","source":"Invitae","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jun 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The interpretation for this sequence variant was made by Invitae based on the ACMG guidelines."}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.6G>T (p.Ala2=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000107720","source":"InSiGHT","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Sep  5 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"Multifactorial likelihood analysis posterior probability 0.001-0.049"},{"scv":"SCV000166285","source":"Invitae","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jun 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The interpretation for this sequence variant was made by Invitae based on the ACMG guidelines."}],"transcript":"NM_000251.2","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(MSH2):c.819A>G (p.Val273=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000166287","source":"Invitae","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Jun 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"This sequence change has not been reported in affected patients and is present in the population (rs146577635, 0.32% in ESP).

This variant was observed in at least one individual diagnosed with colorectal cancer and multiple polyps at age 75 (Plaschke 2000). This variant was absent in 123 healthy controls (Plaschke 2000). Thompson et al. (2013) predicted this variant to be likely not pathogenic based on a combination of tumor characteristics and bioinformatics. MSH6 Phe340Ser was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Phenylalanine and Serine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. MSH6 Phe340Ser alters a position that is well conserved across species and is located in the MSH2 binding site (Kariola 2002). In silico analyses are inconsistent regarding the effect this variant may have on protein structure and function.

This variant has been observed in a case of colon cancer, diagnosed at age 42, whose family met Amsterdam II criteria for Lynch Syndrome. Testing of the proband’s tumor revealed microsatellite stability and the presence of MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 proteins on immunohistochemistry (Peterlongo 2003). MSH6 Gly54Ala was observed once in a series of 1893 unselected ovarian cancer cases (Pal 2012). The International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumors Incorporated (InSiGHT) classifies this variant as Class 2: likely not pathogenic. MSH6 Gly54Ala was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Since Glycine and Alanine share similar properties, this is considered a conservative amino acid substitution. MSH6 Gly54Ala alters a position that is variable across species and is not located in a known functional domain.

This variant was observed in an individual with colon cancer diagnosed under the age of 55; however, analysis of this cancer revealed presence of MLH1, MSH2, and MSH6 proteins by immunohistochemistry and microsatellite stable histology (Barnetson 2008). In addition, the International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours Incorporated (InSiGHT) classifies this variant as likely not pathogenic (Thompson 2014). MSH6 Ser65Leu was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations.

This mutation destroys a canonical splice acceptor site and is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing, leading to either an abnormal message that is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or to an abnormal protein product. Although this mutation has not been previously reported to our knowledge, it is considered pathogenic and is indicative of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition that predisposes to colorectal and endometrial cancer as well as other cancers. The predominant MSH6-related cancer risks for individuals who have not been diagnosed with cancer have been estimated as 44% lifetime risk for colorectal cancer for men, 20% lifetime risk for colorectal cancer in women, 44% lifetime risk for endometrial cancer and 1-11% risk for ovarian cancer in women (Baglietto 2010, Kohlmann 2012). MSH6 carriers also have an increased risk for ovarian, stomach, biliary tract, small bowel, urothelium, and brain cancers (Baglietto 2010). A recent prospective study reported an increased risk for breast cancer and pancreatic cancer in individuals with Lynch syndrome (Win 2012). Some individuals with Lynch syndrome have sebaceous neoplasms of the skin (Muir Torre variant) or glioblastomas (Turcot variant). Individuals with Lynch syndrome who have been diagnosed with colon or endometrial cancers have an increased risk for a second primary diagnosis of a Lynch syndrome-associated cancer (Palomaki 2009, Win 2013).Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMR-D) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by two mutations (one affecting each allele) of the mismatch repair genes including MSH6 This condition is characterized by an increased risk for certain cancers in children including hematologic malignancies, brain tumors, and colon cancer as well as multiple adenomatous polyps and café-au-lait macules (Durno 2010, Wimmer 2010). If a MSH6 mutation carrier's partner is also heterozygous for a MSH6 mutation, the risk to have a child with CMMR-D is 25% with each pregnancy.

c.38A&gt;C at the cDNA level, p.Lys13Thr (K13T) at the protein level, and results in the change of a Lysine to a Threonine (AAG&gt;ACG) in exon 1. This variant was observed in one individual with colorectal cancer and was not observed in 1104 controls; however, the colorectal tumor was microsatellite stable and MSH6 was present on immunohistochemistry testing (Barnetson 2008). MSH6 Lys13Thr was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Since Lysine and Threonine differ in some properties, this is considered a semi-conservative amino acid substitution. MSH6 Lys13Thr alters a position that is well conserved in mammals and is not located in a known functional domain.

This mutation destroys a canonical splice acceptor site and is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing, leading to either an abnormal message that is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or to an abnormal protein product. This mutation, also known as c.892-2A&gt;G using alternate nomenclature, has been observed in several individuals of Asian descent and reported to generate an aberrant mRNA transcript resulting in a truncated protein (Tao 2004, Miyaki 2005, Kim 2007). While a single mutation in the MUTYH gene has been reported in association with a slightly increased risk for colon cancer, endometrial cancer, and breast cancer, particularly among those with a family history of colorectal cancer (Jenkins 2006, Win 2011, Rennert 2012), there are conflicting data regarding these associations (Santonocito 2011, Out 2012). MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP) is an autosomal recessive condition caused by two mutations (one affecting each allele) in the MUTYH gene which results in an increased risk for the development of colon cancer and colon polyps.

Glu334Lys has been reported in at least 3 unrelated Japanese patients with HCM, and was not observed in at least 200 ethnically-matched control chromosomes (Anan R et al., 2007; Bahrudin U et al., 2008). Bahrudin et al. reported that the Glu334Lys mutation causes uniquitin-proteasome system impairment by decreasing the level of proteasome and increasing apoptosis in mutant cells. Glu334Lys represents a non-conservative amino acid substitution of a negatively charged Glutamic acid residue with a positively charged Lysine residue at a position in the protein that is highly conserved across species throughout evolution. In silico analysis predicts this change to be probably damaging to the structure/function of the protein.

Furthermore, the G5R variant was not observed with any significant frequency in approximately 6,000 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. In addition, G5R results in a non-conservative amino acid substitution of a hydrophobic Glycine with a hydrophilic Arginine at a residue that is conserved across mammal species. The G5R mutation has been observed in multiple unrelated individuals tested for cardiomyopathy. In summary, G5R in the MYBPC3 gene is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation. Mutations in the MYBPC3 gene have been reported in 20%-30% of patients with autosomal dominant familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and have been reported less frequently in patients with autosomal dominant familial dilated cardiomyopathy (CirinoAet al., 2011; Hershberger R et al., 2009).

However, positions -3 and -5 to -12 are part of the splicing consensus sequence and variants involving these positions sometimes affect splicing. It should be noted that research on a similar variant in intron 16 of this gene (1458-7C&gt;T) has been demonstrated to result in an altered splice form (personal communication from Dr. Jon Seidman).

In summary, W792R in the MYBPC3 gene is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation.

Hoedemaekers et al. (2010) reported the proband had left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy (LVNC) and was compound heterozygous for G148R and a frameshift mutation in the MYBPC3 gene.

Val321Met was identified in one individual with DCM out of 888 individuals of German ancestry with a diagnosis of HCM or DCM (Waldmuller S et al., 2011). Val321Met was also identified in one male patient with HCM who also harbored another mutation in the MYH7 gene (Maron B et al., 2012). In addition, Val321Met has been observed in multiple other unrelated individuals tested for HCM at GeneDx. Although Val321Met is a conservative amino acid substitution, it affects a Valine residue in the MyBP-C motif between C1 and C2 immunoglobulin-like domains of the cardiac myosin-binding protein C that is highly conserved throughout evolution. Other disease-causing missense mutations have been reported in nearby residues (Ser311Leu, Arg326Gln), further supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. Moreover, Val321Met was not observed with any significant frequency in approximately 6,000 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project.

The E332K variant was not observed in approximately 6,400 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The E332K variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across mammals. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Missense mutations in nearby residues (R326Q, E334K, I336V, G341R) have been reported in association with HCM, supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein.Therefore, this variant is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation, however the possibility that it is a benign variant cannot be excluded. Mutations in the MYBPC3 gene have been reported in 20%-30% of patients with autosomal dominant familial HCM, and have been reported less frequently in patients with autosomal dominant familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) (CirinoA et al., 2011; Hershberger R et al., 2009) .

In one reported family, the G768R mutation co-segregated with an HCM or restrictive cardiomyopathy phenotype and the age of onset ranged from infancy to adulthood (Hinton R et al., 2010). In two studies, the G768R mutation was not present in 200 and 400 chromosomes of matched healthy adult controls (Richard P et al., 2003, Millat et al, 2010). In addition, the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project reports G768R was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American backgrounds, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The G768R mutation results in a non-conservative amino acid substitution of a non-polar Glycine for a positively charged Arginine at a position in the b-myosin heavy chain that is conserved across species. Moreover, missense mutations affecting nearby residues (F764L, F764Y, E774V) have been reported in association with cardiomyopathy, further supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein.

The L1622F variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. However, this substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Furthermore, missense mutations in nearby residues (E1619K, R1634C) have been reported in association with DCM, supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. Therefore, this variant is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation, however the possibility that it is a benign variant cannot be excluded.

The A1637T variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties.

The P211L variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Furthermore, missense mutations in nearby residues (S205Q, K207Q, Q209E, G214D, L216V) have been reported in association with HCM, supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. In summary, P211L in the MYH7 gene is interpreted as disease-causing mutation.

This variant has been reported in an individual with cancer of the larynx (Ziólkowska 2007).

This variant has also been identified in 1 Caucasian infant with DCM by our laboratory (LMM unpublished data) and in 1/8174 European American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs137853197). Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Tyr652Cys variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity.

This variant has not, to our knowledge, been published in the literature as either a mutation or a benign polymorphism. This variant was observed in one familial breast cancer patient (Hellebrand 2011). PALB2 Tyr334Cys was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server. This variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, altering a position that is only moderately conserved throughout evolution and is not located in a known functional domain. In silico analyses predict this variant to have a benign effect on protein structure and function.

This variant has not, to our knowledge, been published in the literature as either a mutation or a benign polymorphism. PALB2 Ile676Thr was not observed at a significant allele frequency in 1000 Genomes. Since Isoleucine and Threonine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution and is likely to affect protein integrity. PALB2 Ile676Thr alters a position that is moderately conserved across species and is not located in a known functional domain.

This is a nonsense mutation, changing a Tryptophan to a premature stop codon. PALB2 Trp1038Ter is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through either protein truncation or nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Casadei et al. (2011) indicates that the G&gt;A change at position 3113 may affect splicing, causing the premature stop. PALB2 Trp1038Ter has been reported previously in association with breast cancer in several publications (Rahman 2007, Wong 2011, Southey 2010). We therefore consider this mutation to be pathogenic.One mutation in the PALB2 (also known as FANCN) gene has been estimated to increase the risk of female breast cancer 2 to 3-fold over the general population (Erkko 2008, Rahman 2007) resulting in a lifetime risk of approximately 25% to 40%. Women with a PALB2 mutation who have a family history of early-onset breast cancer may have a lifetime risk approaching 50% (Byrnes 2008). Heikkinen et al. (2009) found that women with PALB2 mutations, who have been diagnosed with breast cancer, frequently had a high-grade infiltrating ductal carcinoma with 40% overall (20 out of 50) being ER, PR and HER2 negative. Casadei et al. (2011) found that PALB2 mutation carriers are 6-fold more likely to have a family history of pancreatic cancer, 1.3-fold more likely to have a family history of ovarian cancer and 4-fold more likely to have a family history of male breast cancer. Although the association of PALB2 mutations and pancreatic cancer has been established, the exact risks are not yet well-understood (Jones 2009, Slater 2010). Pennington et al.

Moreover, the variant failed to segregate with ARVC in four affected relatives from one large family (Groeneweg 2013). Serine (Ser) at position 140 is not conserved in mammals or evolutionarily distant species and 4 mammals (Tibetan antelope, cow, sheep, domestic goat) carry a Phenlyalanine (Phe) at this position, supporting that this change may be tolerated. Additional computational prediction tools also suggest that the p.Ser140Phe variant may not impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to rule out pathogenicity.

PMS2 Ser46Ile was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Since Serine and Isoleucine differ in some properties, this is considered a semi-conservative amino acid substitution. PMS2 Ser46Ile alters a position that is highly conserved across species and is located in the ATPase domain (Fukui 2011). PMS2 Ser46Ile has been reported in many individuals with Lynch syndrome-associated tumors and in many individuals with autosomal recessive Congenital Mismatch Repair Deficiency syndrome (CMMR-D) who also carried second PMS2 mutations on the opposite chromosome. Tumor testing in many of these individuals showed microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and loss of PMS2 protein expression (Nakagawa 2004, Agostini 2005, Clendenning 2006, Auclair 2007, Jackson 2008, Senter 2008, Van der Klift 2010, Hekert 2011, Leenen 2011). While some functional studies have been inconclusive, several independent in vitro cell-free complementation assays showed deficient mismatch repair activity as well as reduced PMS2 expression (Nakagawa 2004, Borras 2013, Drost 2013). The International Society for Gastrointestinal Hereditary Tumours Incorporated (InSiGHT) classifies this variant as likely pathogenic based on deficient protein function and congruent molecular and clinical phenotype reports (Thompson 2014). PMS2 Ser46Ile is also hypothesized to be a founder mutation among Caucasians (Senter 2008, Tomsic 2013). Finally, in silico analyses predict that this variant is probably damaging to protein structure and function. Based on the currently available information, we consider PMS2 Ser46Ile to be an expected pathogenic variant.While the possibility that this variant is benign cannot be excluded, it is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation. A pathogenic mutation in this gene is indicative of Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant condition that increases ones risk to develop colorectal and endometrial cancer primarily, as well as other types of cancers such as ovarian, gastric, small bowel, urinary tract and biliary. Colon and endometrial cancer are the predominant PMS2-associated cancers that unaffected mutation carriers are at risk to develop. The cumulative colon cancer risk by age 70 for male PMS2 mutation carriers is approximately 20% while female mutation carriers are estimated to have a 15% risk for colon cancer and a 15% risk for endometrial cancer. The risk to develop any Lynch-associated cancer has been estimated to be approximately 25% for men and 32% for women (Senter 2008). Some individuals with PMS2 mutations will be identified as having a variant of Lynch syndrome, characterized by the development of rare LS-associated tumors (both benign and malignant) in addition to the common LS-associated cancers. The Muir-Torre variant is associated with the development of sebaceous neoplasms and keratoacanthomas of the skin while the Turcot variant is associated with the development of glioblastomas. Lynch syndrome patients who have been diagnosed with colon or endometrial cancers have been reported to have an increased risk for a second LS-associated cancer during their lifetime (Palomaki 2009, Win 2013).Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMR-D) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by two mutations (one affecting each allele) of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM). This condition is characterized by an increased risk for certain cancers in children including hematologic malignancies, rhabdomyosarcoma, brain tumors, early onset gastrointestinal tumors as well as dermatological manifestations such as café-au-lait macules (Durno 2010, Wimmer 2010). If an PMS2 mutation carrier's partner is also heterozygous for a PMS2 mutation, the risk to have a child with CMMR-D is 25% for each pregnancy.

The PMS2 Asp60Glu variant has not, to our knowledge, been published in the literature as a mutation or as a benign polymorphism. This variant is a conservative substitution of one negatively-charged amino acid for another and alters a position that is only moderately conserved throughout evolution with Glutamic acid being the naturally occurring amino acid at this position in several species. PMS2 Asp60Glu was not observed at a significant allele frequenct in the NHLBI ESP Exome Variant Server.

This variant has been observed in several individuals with colon and/or endometrial cancer with loss of PMS2 staining on immunohistochemistry (Vaughn 2012, Borras 2013, Tomsic 2013). This mutation was also seen in trans (on opposite chromosomes) with known pathogenic mutations in PMS2 in three individuals with a phenotype consistent with constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome (Senter 2008). We therefore consider this mutation to be pathogenic and is indicative of Lynch syndrome (LS), an autosomal dominant condition that increases ones risk to develop colorectal and endometrial cancer primarily, as well as other types of cancers such as ovarian, gastric, small bowel, urinary tract and biliary. Colon and endometrial cancer are the predominant PMS2-associated cancers that unaffected mutation carriers are at risk to develop. The cumulative colon cancer risk by age 70 for male PMS2 mutation carriers is approximately 20% while female mutation carriers are estimated to have a 15% risk for colon cancer and a 15% risk for endometrial cancer. The risk to develop any Lynch-associated cancer has been estimated to be approximately 25% for men and 32% for women (Senter 2008). Some individuals with PMS2 mutations will be identified as having a variant of Lynch syndrome, characterized by the development of rare LS-associated tumors (both benign and malignant) in addition to the common LS-associated cancers. The Muir-Torre variant is associated with the development of sebaceous neoplasms and keratoacanthomas of the skin while the Turcot variant is associated with the development of glioblastomas. Lynch syndrome patients who have been diagnosed with colon or endometrial cancers have been reported to have an increased risk for a second LS-associated cancer during their lifetime (Palomaki 2009, Win 2013).Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMR-D) syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by two mutations (one affecting each allele) of the mismatch repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM). This condition is characterized by an increased risk for certain cancers in children including hematologic malignancies, rhabdomyosarcoma, brain tumors, early onset gastrointestinal tumors as well as dermatological manifestations such as café-au-lait macules (Durno 2010, Wimmer 2010). If a PMS2 mutation carrier's partner also carries a PMS2 mutation, the risk to have a child with CMMR-D is 25% for each pregnancy. The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000166382","source":"Invitae","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Jun 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The interpretation for this sequence variant was made by Invitae based on the ACMG guidelines.

Thompson (2013) categorized this variant as a polymorphism due to its African subpopulation frequency in 1000 genomes as greater than 1%; however, subsequent curation of this data revealed that the two variant carriers in this subpopulation were related. After adjusting for this, the frequency drops below 1%, not frequent enough to be automatically classified as a benign polymorphism. Consistent with an allele frequency below 1%, PMS2 Thr277Lys was also observed with an allele frequency of 0.4% (17/4406) in African Americans in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Since Threonine and Lysine differ in some properties, this is considered a semi-conservative amino acid substitution. PMS2 Thr277Lys alters a position that is variable through vertebrates and is located in the ATPase domain (Fukui 2011).

The NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project and the 1000 Genomes Project reports D556N was observed with a minor allele frequency of 0.7-1.5%, especially in individuals of European ancestry.

The D464N variant has not beenpublished as a mutation, nor has it been reported as a benign polymorphism to our knowledge. The D464N variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. In addition, D464N variant was not detected in 616 alleles from control individuals of various ethnic backgrounds tested at GeneDx. The D464N variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. Mutations in nearby residues have not been reported in association with HCM or WPW syndrome, indicating this region of the protein may tolerate change. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic mutation or a rare benign variant.

However, this individual's affected mother and brother, both of whom presented with a more typical HCM phenotype, as well as another clinically-unaffected brother (who had hypertophy of the papillary muscle) harbored two mutations in the MYBPC3 gene, thus making it unclear what contribution, if any, the P83S variant in PRKAG2 had on the development of HCM in this family (Waldmuller S et al., 2010). While P83S results in a non-conservative amino acid substitution of a non-polar Proline with a polar Serine, the P83 residue is not conserved across species. In addition, in silico analysis predicts P83S likely has a benign effect on the protein structure/function. Furthermore, disease causing mutations in nearby residues have not been reported, indicating this region of the protein may tolerate change. The NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project reports P83S was observed in 6/8598 alleles from individuals of European background, and in 2/4406 alleles from individuals of African American background, indicating it may be a rare benign variant in these populations. With the clinical and molecular information available at this time, we cannot definitively determine if P83S is a disease-causing mutation or a rare benign variant.

The surrounding sequence, with the bases that are deleted in brackets is gtca{gta}ttat. This variant was observed in two breast/ovarian cancer families in the literature as well as one healthy control (Loveday 2012, Golmard 2013). This intronic variant was predicted by multiple algorithms to greatly impact or destroy the natural splice acceptor site, and was shown by mRNA studies to create a truncated protein caused by exon 8 skipping and a resulting frameshift (Golmard 2013). Based on the currently available information, we consider RAD51C c.1026+5_1026+7delGTA to be an expected pathogenic mutation.While the possibility that this variant is benign cannot be excluded, it is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation. Pathogenic mutations in the RAD51C gene have been reported to cause dominantly inherited predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer. Meindl et al. (2010) first reported this association in a cohort of 1,100 unrelated German women affected with cancer from hereditary breast cancer families or hereditary breast and ovarian cancer families. They identified six RAD51C pathogenic mutations which were found only in the 480 families with both breast and ovarian cancer and not the families with breast cancer only or in nearly 3,000 controls. Walsh et al. (2011) also identified RAD51C mutations in 2/360 patients with ovarian cancer, peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer unselected for family history. Loveday et al.

Three additional studies were not able to confirm the role of RAD51C mutations in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (Akbari 2010, De Leeneer 2012, Zheng 2010).Two mutations (one affecting each allele) in the RAD51C gene can cause a Fanconi Anemia (FA)-like disorder (Vaz 2010).

Functional studies indicate this variant may lead to altered TTN splicing, another gene encoding a protein that is strongly associated with DCM (Guo 2012); however, this in vitro assay may not accurately represent biological function. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Arg636Ser variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In addition, this variant lies within exon 9, which encodes a conserved protein domain where other pathogenic variants have been reported (Brauch 2009, Li 2010).

A57G is a conservative amino acid substitution as both Alanine and Glycine are neutral, non-polar residues. Alanine is conserved at this position in most mammals, although Glycine is the reference allele at this position in squirrel. In silico analysis predicts that this alteration is damaging to the protein structure/function. While A57 has not been reported as tested, mutagenesis assays demonstrating a change in function have been performed for nearby residues (UniProt #Q92963 S35N, T53S, E55G, Q79L). Additionally, the A57G variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, nor was it identified in the 1000 Genomes Project. We interpret A57G as a variant of unknown significance.

Although M173I is a conservative amino acid substitution as both Methionine and Isoleucine are non-polar residues, Methionine is highly conserved at this position across species. The only mutation published to date in the SHOC2 gene is the S2G mutation. In silico algorithms are inconsistent in predicting the effect of M173I.

While familial studies support a combined, additive effect of more than 1 variant, only 1 family directly implicates the Thr143Asn variant (in the other family, a third variant of unknown significance was present and co-inherited together with the Thr143Asn variant from the affected father). This variant has not been identified in large population studies. Mouse studies have shown that phosphorylation at threonine 143 (position 144 in mice) plays an important role in the regulation of muscle contractility (Noland 1995, Vahebi 2005, Wang 2006, Mathur 2008). A change from threonine to asparagine (Asn) abolishes this phosphorylation site and may therefore have functional consequences. The variant was also predicted to be pathogenic using a computational tool clinically validated by our laboratory. This tool's pathogenic prediction is estimated to be correct 94% of the time (Jordan 2011). However, threonine (Thr) at position 143 is not conserved in evolution, and asparagine (Asn) is present in multiple species (frog and 9 fishes). While the familial studies, absence from large populations and computational predictions all suggest that this variant plays a role in disease, the lack of evolutionary conservation and presence of the variant amino acid in multiple species suggests that this change may be tolerated.

The R94L mutation in the TNNT2 gene has been reported in association with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Varnava A et al., 1999). The R94L mutation in the troponin T2 gene has been reported in two affected individuals from a three-generation family with HCM, with marked myocyte disarray and frequent premature sudden death, but minimal myocardial hypertrophy at clinical or macroscopic level, and was not found in 100 normal control individuals (Varnava A et al., 1999). Furthermore, the R94L mutation was not observed inapproximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Palm T et al. (2001) showed that mutations between residues 92-110 of the TNNT2 gene impair tropomyosin binding or TnT enhancement of tropomyosin binding to actin. The authors showed that R94L reduced tropomyosin affinity, in that it eluted about half the ionic strength of the wild type allele (Palm T et al., 2001). However, Lu QW et al. (2003) performed an assay using a quartz-crystal microbalance, a sensitive mass-measuring device, and demonstrated that R94L mutations had no effect on the interaction between cTnT and alpha-tropomyosin. The authors also showed that R94L resulted in an increase in the Ca2+ sensitivity of force generation (Lu QW et al., 2003). On the other hand, Harada K and Potter JD (2004) examined the structural and functional properties of R94L mutation and showed that it increased the Ca2+ sensitivity of force development but not the maximal force but decreased the change in Ca2+ sensitivity of force development observed in lowering the pH from 7 to 6.5, suggesting this mutation can perturb the proper response of cardiac contraction to changes in pH. R94L was also shown to alter the contractile properties of porcine skinned cardiac muscle fibers, in that it decreased the ability to displace the tropomyosin complex in the fibers (Harada K and Potter JD, 2004). R94L represents a non-conservative amino acid substitution that changes the hydrophilicity and electrical charge at a highly conserved site in the troponin T protein, at a position that is conserved across species (Varnava A et al., 1999). Missense mutations at the same residue (R94C, R94H) and mutations in nearby residues (V85L, D86A, F87C, I90M, R92Q, R92L, R92W, E96K, K97N, A104V) have been reported in association with cardiomyopathy, further supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. In summary, R94L in the TNNT2 gene is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation.

Mutations in TNNT2 have been reported less frequently in association with autosomal dominant familial dilated cardiomyopathy (Hershberger R et al., 2009). The A104V mutation in the TNNT2 gene has been reported in association with HCM (Nakajima-Tamiguchi C et al., 1997; Palm T et al., 2001; Harada K et al., 2004; Lopes et al., 2013). A104V results in a conservative amino acid substitution of one non-polar amino acid with another, which occurs at a position that is conserved through chickens (Nakajima-Tamiguchi C et al., 1997). Nakajima-Tamiguchi et al. identified this mutation in a proband of a Japanese family with moderate HCM and a family history of sudden death. In a large scale analysis of sarcomere gene variants, Lopes et al., identified A104V in three individuals with HCM (Lopes et al., 2013). Additionally, A104V lies within a critical region (Palm T et al., 2001), and a functional study reports this mutation alters the contractile properties of skinned cardiac fibers (Harada K et al., 2004). Furthermore, Hinkle A et al. reports the A104 residue is important in troponin folding. The NHLBI ESP Exome Variant Server reports A104V was not observed in approximately 6,500 samples from individuals of European and African American backgrounds, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. In summary, A104V in the TNNT2 gene is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation. Hereditary hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is primarily an autosomal dominant disease characterized by myocardial hypertrophy in the absence of other cardiac or systemic causes. HCM is most frequently caused by mutations in genes coding for sarcomeric proteins in the cardiac muscle leading to myocyte disarray, a hallmark feature of HCM. Less commonly, ventricular hypertrophy is a presenting feature of genetic systemic disorders, such as Danon disease, Fabry disease, or mitochondrial cardiomyopathy. HCM has a variable clinical presentation; including palpitations, chest pain, heart failure, syncope, or sudden death, although some individuals may be asymptomatic (Marian A et al., 1995; Maron B, 2002).

The R139C variant was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The R139C variant is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in mammals. In silico analysis predicts this variant is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. A missense change in the same residue (R139H) has been reported as a novel mutation (Morales et al., 2010).

Hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is primarily an autosomal dominant disease characterized by left ventricular enlargement and systolic dysfunction in the absence of other cardiac, systemic or environmental causes (Hershberger R et al., 2009).

LVNC and DCM can lead to progressive deterioration of cardiac function, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death, although some individuals may be asymptomatic. Hereditary DCM is most frequently caused by mutations in genes encoding for sarcomeric proteins in the cardiac muscle, or in the gene encoding the nuclear envelope protein lamin A/C (LMNA). Less commonly, DCM and LVNC can be caused by mutations in genes associated with metabolic or mitochondrial disorders (Callis T et al., 2010; Hershberger R et al., 2009).

Mutations in TNNT2 have been reported less frequently in association with autosomal dominant familial dilated cardiomyopathy (Hershberger R et al., 2009). The R205W mutation in the TNNT2 gene has been reported in a pediatric patient with DCM and it was absent from 253 control individuals (Hershberger R et al., 2008; Hershberger R et al., 2009). Also, functional studies indicate R205W decreased calcium sensitivity (Hershberger T et al., 2009). R205W results in a non-conservative amino acid substitution of a positively charged Arginine with a non-polar Tryptophan at a position that is conserved across species. Another missense mutation at this residue (R205L) has been reported in association with DCM, further supporting the functional importance of this residue. Additionally, R205W was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. In summary, R205W in the TNNT2 gene is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation. Hereditary dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is primarily an autosomal dominant disease characterized by left ventricular enlargement and systolic dysfunction in the absence of other cardiac, systemic or environmental causes (Hershberger R et al., 2009). Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a rare cardiomyopathy characterized by deep trabeculations with intertrabecular recesses in the ventricular wall (Callis T et al., 2010). LVNC and DCM can lead to progressive deterioration of cardiac function, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death, although some individuals may be asymptomatic. Hereditary DCM is most frequently caused by mutations in genes encoding for sarcomeric proteins in the cardiac muscle, or in the gene encoding the nuclear envelope protein lamin A/C (LMNA). Less commonly, DCM and LVNC can be caused by mutations in genes associated with metabolic or mitochondrial disorders (Callis T et al., 2010; Hershberger R et al., 2009).

Furthermore, multiple functional studies reported that the E244D mutation and other missense substitutions of this codon increase the maximum level of myosin ATPase activity without altering calcium sensitivity (Yanaga F et al., 1999; Harada K et al., 2004; Matsumoto F et al., 2009).

In summary, R286H in the TNNT2 gene is interpreted as a disease-causing mutation. Mutations in the TNNT2 gene have been reported in 5-15% of patients with autosomal dominant familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, often characterized by minimal left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) but a high incidence of sudden cardiac death (Moolman J et al., 1997; Cirino A et al., 2011). Mutations in TNNT2 have been reported less frequently in association with autosomal dominant familial dilated cardiomyopathy (Hershberger R et al., 2009). The variant is found in HCM,CARDIOMYOPATHY panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000190645","source":"CSER_CC_NCGL","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Jun  1 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000364.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(TNNT2):c.878G>A (p.Arg293His)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000060281","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"May  2 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The Arg286His variant in TNNT2 has been reported in at least 6 individuals with HCM and was absent from 1000 control chromosomes (Van Driest 2003, Andersen 2009, Yang 2011).

The following core cancer types account for 70%-77% of LFS-associated tumors (in order of frequency): breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma (Gonzalez 2009, Olivier 2003, Ruijs 2010). Other types of cancer that have been reported to be associated with LFS include ovarian, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, genitourinary, skin, thyroid and lung cancers as well as leukemia, lymphoma, and neuroblastomas. Age-related and sex-specific cancer risks have been reported. According to one study, the overall risks for males with LFS to develop cancer by ages 16, 45, and 85 are estimated to be 19%, 41%, and 73%, respectively, whereas the risks for females are estimated to be 12%, 84%, and 100%, respectively (Chompret 2000). The higher penetrance in females is due to the high incidence of breast cancer, accounting for 80% of the cancers in the age group of 16 to 45 years (Chompret 2000). The majority of LFS-associated breast cancers are HER2/neu positive ductal carcinomas (Melhem-Bertrandt 2012). The most common types of sarcomas in LFS are rhabdomyosarcomas before age 5 and osteosarcomas at any age (Ognjanovic 2012). LFS is associated with many types of brain tumors including astrocytomas, glioblastomas, medulloblastomas and choroid plexus carcinomas, and they can occur in childhood or adulthood (Olivier 2003). Individuals with LFS who have been diagnosed with cancer have up to a 57% risk of a second primary cancer within 30 years of the first diagnosis and up to a 38% risk of a third primary diagnosis (Hisada 1998). Several studies have demonstrated that subsequent tumors often develop in the radiation field of the previously treated cancer (Chompret 2000, Hisada 1998).

The following core cancer types account for 70-77% of LFS-associated tumors (in order of frequency): breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma (Gonzalez 2009, Olivier 2003, Ruijs 2010). Other types of cancer that have been reported to be associated with LFS include ovarian, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, genitourinary, skin, thyroid and lung cancers as well as leukemia, lymphoma, and neuroblastomas.

According to one study, the overall risks for males with LFS to develop cancer by ages 16, 45, and 85 are estimated to be 19%, 41%, and 73%, respectively, whereas the risks for females are estimated to be 12%, 84%, and 100%, respectively (Chompret 2000).

Since Alanine and Threonine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution. TP53 Ala161Thr alters a position that is well conserved across species and is located in the DNA binding domain and the regions of interaction with HIPK1, ZNF385A, FBXO42, and AXIN1 (UniProt). In silico analyses predict that this variant is probably damaging to protein structure and function. Based on the currently available information, we consider TP53 Ala161Thr to be a variant, expected pathogenic.While the possibility that this variant is benign cannot be excluded, it is a strong candidate for a pathogenic mutation. A pathogenic mutation in this gene is indicative of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), an autosomal dominant condition associated with a high-risk for a broad range of childhood- and adult-onset cancers. The following core cancer types account for 70-77% of LFS-associated tumors (in order of frequency): breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, brain tumors, osteosarcoma, and adrenocortical carcinoma (Gonzalez 2009, Olivier 2003, Ruijs 2010). Other types of cancer that have been reported to be associated with LFS include ovarian, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, genitourinary, skin, thyroid and lung cancers as well as leukemia, lymphoma, and neuroblastomas. Age-related and sex-specific cancer risks have been reported. According to one study, the overall risks for males with LFS to develop cancer by ages 16, 45, and 85 are estimated to be 19%, 41%, and 73%, respectively, whereas the risks for females are estimated to be 12%, 84%, and 100%, respectively (Chompret 2000). The higher penetrance in females is due to the high incidence of breast cancer, accounting for 80% of the cancers in the age group of 16 to 45 years (Chompret 2000). The majority of LFS-associated breast cancers are HER2/neu positive ductal carcinomas (Melhem-Bertrandt 2012). The most common types of sarcomas in LFS are rhabdomyosarcomas before age 5 and osteosarcomas at any age (Ognjanovic 2012). LFS is associated with many types of brain tumors including astrocytomas, glioblastomas, medulloblastomas and choroid plexus carcinomas, and they can occur in childhood or adulthood (Olivier 2003). Individuals with LFS who have been diagnosed with cancer have up to a 57% risk of a second primary cancer within 30 years of the first diagnosis and up to a 38% risk of a third primary diagnosis (Hisada 1998). Several studies have demonstrated that subsequent tumors often develop in the radiation field of the previously treated cancer (Chompret 2000, Hisada 1998). Approximately 24% of LFS cases result from a de novo, rather than inherited, mutation in the TP53 gene (Chompret 2000). The variant is found in HEREDICANCER panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_001126115.1","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(TP53):c.869G>A (p.Arg290His)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000149649","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Oct  9 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"This variant is denoted TP53 c.869G&gt;A at the cDNA level, p.Arg290His (R290H) at the protein level, and results in the change of an Arginine to a Histidine (CGC&gt;CAC) in exon 8. The variant was observed in at least one Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and one Li-Fraumeni-like family (Quesnel 1999). The LFS proband, with a rhabdomyosarcoma and a brain tumor in childhood, also carried a pathogenic TP53 mutation in trans. Although TP53 Arg290His did not appear to affect protein activity in vitro, it did result in lower protein levels, leading the authors to suggest that maybe this allele contributed to the severe phenotype in this child (Quesnel 1999). To further the idea of this variant acting in concert with other p53 variants, a study of somatic mutations in tumors revealed that in 5 of 11 tumors withTP53 Arg290His, another a second mutation was present, suggesting that a second hit in addition to this variant may be necessary for full TP53 inactivation (Soussi 2005). TP53 Arg290His was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Variant Server. This variant is a conservative substitution of one positive polar amino acid for another, altering a position that is moderately conserved throughout evolution, with an R&gt;H change tolerated in many species, and is located in the interaction domain with E4F1. In silico analyses are inconsistent with regard to the effect this variant may have on protein structure and function.

Phe64Leu was reported in an African American individual with carpal tunnel syndrome, polyneuropathy, and heart involvement, and this mutation was reported to affect the stability of the TTR tetramers (Altland K et al., 2007). Phe64Leu (reported due to different nomenclature) was also reported in an African American patient with amyloidosis who also harbored the Val142Ile mutation the opposite allele (Connors L et al., 2009). The Phe64Leu mutation was not observed with any significant frequency in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Other mutations affecting the same residue (Phe64Tyr, Phe64Ser) and nearby residues (Glu62Lys, Ala65Ser) have been reported in association with amyloidosis, further supporting the functional importance of this residue and this region of the protein.

Individuals with this mutation typically present with earlier onset, aggressive, amyloidosis, and polynueropathy. Gonzalez-Duarte et al. (2012) concluded men had considerably worse outcomes. The S70R mutation is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution as these residues share similar properties, but differ in size, charge, or other properties which may impact secondary structure. Mutations in the same residue (S70I) and nearby residues (T69I, T69P, E71G, S72P, G73R) have been reported in association with familial transthyretin amyloidosis, further supporting the functional importance of this residue and region of the protein.

VHL Pro81Ser was not observed at a significant allele frequency in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. Since Proline and Serine differ in polarity, charge, size or other properties, this is considered a non-conservative amino acid substitution and is likely to affect protein integrity. VHL Pro81Ser alters a position that is moderately conserved across species and is located in the known functional B-domain (Weirich 2002). In silico analyses predict that this variant is unlikely to alter protein structure or function. This variant has been reported in several individuals and families with Von Hippel Lindau-related cancers (Zbar 1996, GlÃ¤sker 1999, Hes 2000, Weirich 2002, Erlic 2010). However, some pieces of evidence reduce the likelihood of pathogenicity, or at least of full penetrance. First, this variant was identified in families who also carried a likely deleterious VHL mutation in cis (Weirich 2002, Erlic 2010). In addition, this variant was indentified in a family with a large deletion of the entire VHL gene in trans, in whom VHL Pro81Ser did not segregate with disease (Erlic 2010). Finally, Hes et al.

Therefore, despite some functional and family segregation data suggesting neutrality, since we cannot rule out a modifying effect of VHL Pro81Ser or low penetrance, we are classifying it as a variant of unknown significance.

The variant is found in HEREDICANCER,PANC-HEREDIC panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000551.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(VHL):c.241C>T (p.Pro81Ser)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000022479","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Apr 22 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000053257","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000551.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(VHL):c.340+5G>C","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053260","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000166408","source":"Invitae","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Jun 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"This sequence change is present in the general population at an elevated frequency (rs61758376, 0.7%), and is likely benign."},{"scv":"SCV000149654","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Aug 28 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in HEREDICANCER panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000184770","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Dec 13 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000205380","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jun 21 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"340+5G&gt;C in intron 1 of VHL: This variant is not expected to have clinical significance because it has been identified in 4.5% (9/200) Southern Han Chinese chromosomes by the 1000 Genomes Project (dbSNP rs61758376)."}],"transcript":"NM_000551.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(VHL):c.340+5G>C","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053260","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000149654","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Aug 28 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in HEREDICANCER panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000551.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(VHL):c.340+5G>C","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053260","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000184770","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Dec 13 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_000551.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(VHL):c.340+5G>C","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000053260","source":"LabCorp","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Aug 18 2011 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000205380","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jun 21 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"340+5G&gt;C in intron 1 of VHL: This variant is not expected to have clinical significance because it has been identified in 4.5% (9/200) Southern Han Chinese chromosomes by the 1000 Genomes Project (dbSNP rs61758376)."}],"transcript":"NM_000551.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(VHL):c.416C>G (p.Ser139Cys)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000166409","source":"Invitae","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Jun 11 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The interpretation for this sequence variant was made by Invitae based on the ACMG guidelines."},{"scv":"SCV000211813","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Jul 24 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"A S139C missense change likely associated with von Hippel Lindau syndrome was identified in the VHL gene. It has not been published as a mutation, nor has it been reported as a benign polymorphism to our knowledge. The S139C variant was not observed in approximately 6,000 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Although Serine and Cysteine are both uncharged, polar amino acids, the gain of Cysteine residue may affect disulfide bond formation in the protein. S139C alters a conserved position position in the protein, and many other missense mutations have been reported at nearby codons. Additionally, multiple in silico algorithms predict S139C may be damaging to protein structure/function. Therefore, S139C is a strong candidate for a disease-causing mutation, however the possibility that it is a benign variant cannot be excluded.

at the protein level, c.3211 T&gt;C at the cDNA level, and results in the change of a Serine for a Proline (TCG&gt;CCG) in exon 10 of the ZEB2 gene (NM_014795.2). The Ser1071Pro missense change has not been published as a mutation, nor has it been reported as a benign polymorphism to our knowledge. It was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The amino acid substitution is non-conservative as a polar Serine residue is replaced by a non-polar Proline residue and the gain of a Proline may affect the secondary structure of the ZEB2 protein. Ser1071Pro alters a conserved position in one of the zinc finger domains and multiple in-silico algorithms predict Ser1071Pro may be damaging to the structure/function of the protein. However, missense mutations in the ZEB2 gene are rare and have been identified in less than 2% of patients with Mowat- Wilson syndrome (Garavelli et al., 2009). Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether Ser1071Pro is a disease-causing mutation or a rare benign variant. The variant is found in CHILD-EPI panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_014795.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(ZEB2):c.462G>A (p.Glu154=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000169859","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"May  2 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in EPILEPSY,INFANT-EPI panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000195499","source":"Genetic Services Laboratory, University of Chicago","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Feb  8 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_014795.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(ZEB2):c.489C>T (p.Ile163=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000113602","source":"Emory Genetics Laboratory","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Sep 13 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000195500","source":"Genetic Services Laboratory, University of Chicago","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Apr 10 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""}],"transcript":"NM_014795.3","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"(ZEB2):c.9G>C (p.Gln3His)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000195509","source":"Genetic Services Laboratory, University of Chicago","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Feb  4 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000209409","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"May  5 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in INFANT-EPI,EPILEPSY panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_014795.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(ZIC3):c.649C>G (p.Pro217Ala)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000032426","source":"OMIM","significance":"Pathogenic","evalDate":"Sep 11 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000169886","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"May 20 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in HETEROTAXY panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_003413.3","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"(ZMPSTE24):c.651T>C (p.Asp217=)","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000113253","source":"Emory Genetics Laboratory","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jul 23 2013 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000153577","source":"Genetic Services Laboratory, University of Chicago","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"","comments":"Likely benign based on allele frequency in 1000 Genomes Project or ESP global frequency and its presence in a patient with a rare or unrelated disease phenotype.

Although the c.1888+1 G&gt;A mutation in the MYH7 gene has not been reported previously, this mutation destroys the canonical splice acceptor site in intron 16, and is expected to cause abnormal gene splicing.

In one Italian family with Parkinsonism, deafness and neuropathy, the variant segregated with hearing loss in at least two additional maternally related family members (Thyagaragan 2000). In another family the variant segregated with nonsyndromic hearing loss in 4 family members (Tessa 2001), though alternate dominant inheritance cannot be ruled out. One Chinese proband affected with auditory neuropathy was identified to carry this variant (Wang 2005) as well as 10 other Chinese probands with hearing loss (Lu 2010). Studies have shown that the 1095T&gt;C variant impacts function (Thyagarajan 2000, Muderman 2012). However, these in vitro assays may not accurately represent biological function. In addition, this variant has now been found in higher frequency (~1%) in several control populations of Asian background (1/124, 4/921, 1/96, 1/112) (see LOVD database http://www.lovd.nl/2.0; mtDB http://www.mtdb.igp.uu.se; HmtDB http://www.hmtdb.uniba.it:8080/hmdb). Also, one study asserted that this variant represents a sub-haplotype of an East-Asian population and is not disease causing (Yao 2006). In summary, because of conflicting data regarding the pathogenicity of the 1095T&gt;C variant, the clinical significance of this variant is uncertain; however, the variability of phenotypes described and the presence of the variant at 1% frequency in Asian control populations suggest that the variant is more likely to be benign."},{"scv":"SCV000185942","source":"Ambry Genetics","significance":"Likely benign","evalDate":"Aug 10 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":""},{"scv":"SCV000211613","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Jun 13 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC,HEREDICANCER panel(s)."},{"scv":"SCV000063783","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Mar  1 2012 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The 25873-12T&gt;C variant (TTN) has been identified in 0.2% (14/6570) of European American chromosomes from a broad population by NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project in a broad population (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs143352892) and has been identified in 1 individual with HCM tested by our laboratory.

The higher penetrance in females is due to the high incidence of breast cancer, accounting for 80% of the cancers in the age group of 16 to 45 years (Chompret 2000). The majority of LFS-associated breast cancers are HER2/neu positive ductal carcinomas (Melhem-Bertrandt 2012). The most common types of sarcomas in LFS are rhabdomyosarcomas before age 5 and osteosarcomas at any age (Ognjanovic 2012). LFS is associated with many types of brain tumors including astrocytomas, glioblastomas, medulloblastomas and choroid plexus carcinomas, and they can occur in childhood or adulthood (Olivier 2003). Individuals with LFS who have been diagnosed with cancer have up to a 57% risk of a second primary cancer within 30 years of the first diagnosis and up to a 38% risk of a third primary diagnosis (Hisada 1998). Several studies have demonstrated that subsequent tumors often develop in the radiation field of the previously treated cancer (Chompret 2000, Hisada 1998).

Individuals with LFS who have been diagnosed with cancer have up to a 57% risk of a second primary cancer within 30 years of the first diagnosis and up to a 38% risk of a third primary diagnosis (Hisada 1998). Several studies have demonstrated that subsequent tumors often develop in the radiation field of the previously treated cancer (Chompret 2000, Hisada 1998). Approximately 24% of LFS cases result from a de novo, rather than inherited, mutation in the TP53 gene (Chompret 2000). The variant is found in BR-OV-HEREDIC panel(s)."}],"transcript":"NM_000546.5:c.1101-2A>","conflict":0,"discrepency":1},{"name":"G","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000204296","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Likely pathogenic","evalDate":"Jun  4 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The 1228-2A&gt;G variant in CBL has previously been identified in 5 individuals with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML; Niemeyer 2010, Perez 2010, Park 2012, Loh 2009), in each of whom it was identified in the homozygous state in the leukemia cells.

As this mutation destroys the canonical splice acceptor site in intron 8, it is expected to cause abnormal gene splicing and likely results in loss-of-function of the encoded tumor suppressor protein. Heterozygous germline mutations in CBL typically cause clinical features that overlap with disorders of the Noonan syndrome spectrum, including growth and developmental delay, dysmorphic features, congenital heart disease, cryptorchidism, cafe'-au-lait spots, and a predisposition to JMML (Loh et al., 2009; Niemayer et al., 2009). Approximately 10-15% of children with JMML are homozygous for a CBL mutation due to somatic loss of heterozygosity for a region on chromosome 11q (acquired isodisomy) in leukemia cells (Loh et al., 2009; Perez et al., 2010; Makishima et al., 2009).

The c.1096-4_1096_1delAAAG mutation in intron 7 in the CBL gene (NM_005188.2) has not been reported previously as a disease-causing mutation nor as a benign polymorphism, to our knowledge. This mutation has previously been observed at GeneDx in a patient referred for testing of the comprehensive panel for Noonan syndrome and related disorders. The c.1096-4_1096-1delAAAG mutation was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The c.1096-4_1096-1delAAAG mutation in the CBL gene destroys the splice acceptor site of exon 8, which is an in-frame exon encoding portions of the Zn-finger ring and linker region. The c.1096-4_1096-1delAAAG mutation is predicted to cause abnormal gene splicing, either leading to an abnormal message that is subject to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, or to an abnormal protein product if the message is used for protein translation. Another splice site mutation that destroys this acceptor site (c.1096-1 G&gt;C) has been reported in a homozygous state in a patient with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), caf? au lait spots, cryptorchidism, juvenile xanthogranuloma, poor growth, and developmental delay (Niemeyer et al., 2010).

Therefore, the clinical significance of this variant cannot be determined at this time."},{"scv":"SCV000170535","source":"GeneDx","significance":"Benign","evalDate":"Feb  5 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The variant is found in DCM-CRDM,CARDIOMYOPATHY panel(s)."}],"transcript":"MYH7:c.4354-7C>","discrepency":0,"conflict":1},{"name":"T","labInterps":[{"scv":"SCV000059514","source":"Laboratory for Molecular Medicine,Partners HealthCare Personalized Medicine","significance":"Uncertain significance","evalDate":"Sep 19 2014 12:00:00:000AM","comments":"The 3726+6C&gt;T variant in MYH7 has been identified by our laboratory in 2 Caucasian adults with HCM, one of whom carries a pathogenic variant in the MYBPC3 gene.
