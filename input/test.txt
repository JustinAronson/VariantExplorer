This variant is located in the 3' splice region. Computational tools do not suggest a strong impact on splicing, though this information is not predictive enough to rule out pathogenicity. While the frequency of this variant suggests that it is more likely to be benign, it is too low to confidently rule out a disease causing role. At this time, additional information is needed to fully assess its clinical significance.	2

The variant has been also reported in 0.12% (82/67552) of European chromosomes by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (http://exac.broadinstitute.org; dbSNP rs146132083), though this frequency is not high enough to rule out a pathogenic role. Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses suggest that the Pro533Ser variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, while the clinical significance of the p.Pro533Ser variant is uncertain, its frequency in the general population suggests that it is more likely to be benign.	2

Data from large population studies are insufficient to determine its frequency. This variant is located in the 5'UTR at the -5 nucleotide position which is not conserved across species. Although we cannot rule out a deleterious impact on the regulation of splicing or translation of KCNQ1, to date no disease-causing variants have been found in this region of the transcript. In summary, the clinical significance of this variant cannot be determined with certainty at this time; however based upon the available data, we would lean towards a more likely benign role.	-1

The variant has also been reported in a patient with clinical features of Rett syndrome and her unaffected mother, who had a normal pattern of X-inactivation (Temudo et al., 2009). This variant is a conservative substitution of one uncharged, non-polar amino acid for another at a position that is not conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this variant is likely benign. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether Val380Met is a disease-causing mutation or a rare benign variant. The variant is found in EPILEPSY panel(s).	-1

Of note, Conforti reports this variant using different protein nomenclature (p.S388P) but the same c.1162 C&gt;T. P388S was subsequently identified in a female with a clinical diagnosis of Rett syndrome; however parental studies were not performed (Zahorakova et al., 2007). A different amino acid substitution at the same position (P388L) was reported as a disease-causing mutation in a female with Rett syndrome; however, the change was inherited from her unaffected mother (Milunsky et al., 2001). P388S was not observed in approximately 6,300 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. It is a non-conservative amino acid substitution, which is likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in polarity, charge, size and/or other properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in mammals, but is not conserved in more distantly related species. In silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic mutation or a rare benign variant. The variant is found in CHILD-EPI panel(s).	-1

The deletion causes a frameshift starting with codon Proline 389 and changes this amino acid to a premature Stop codon, denoted p.Pro389Stop. This mutation is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation, as the last 98 amino acids of the MECP2 protein are lost.

The deletion causes an in-frame loss of two Proline amino acids at codon 390 and 391, denoted p.Pro390_Pro391del. The c.1168_1173delCCACCT variant is described as a polymorphism in a gene specific mutation database as this variant was reported in an unaffected family member. Additionally, this variant is present in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project using alternate transcript numbering and has been observed in the homozygous state in a female and hemizygous in three males. This variant has been observed to be maternally inherited. The variant is found in MECP2 panel(s).	-1

This amino acid substitution was not identified in 100 control individuals. It was also identified in the individuals mother and sister, who both had borderline intelligence. Other male family members were unavailable for testing and therefore the authors reported Pro405Leu as an unclassified variant of unknown significance (Moog et al., 2006). In another separate study, Pro405Leu was found as a de novo mutation in a male with intellectual disability, macrocephaly, hyperactivity, and stereotypical hand movements (Campos et al., 2009). It was absent in 106 healthy male and female controls. In addition, Campos et al. commented that Pro405Leu is located in a region of the protein that may be involved in protein-protein interactions and that in silico prediction models categorized it as potentially damaging. Therefore, Pro405Leu was interpreted as a likely pathogenic mutation associated with mental retardation in males. The NHLBI ESP Exome Variant Project has not identified Pro405Leu in approximately 6,400 individuals of European or African American ethnicity, indicating that it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Although both Proline and Leucine are uncharged, non-polar amino acid residues, the loss of a bulky Proline residue may affect the secondary structure of the MECP2 protein. Pro405Leu alters a highly conserved position in the protein and several in silico algorithms predict that it may be damaging to the structure/function of the protein. However, other missense substitutions in this region (Ser401Leu, Pro402Leu) are classified as benign variants. In addition, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether Pro405Leu is a disease-causing mutation or a rare benign variant. The variant is found in INFANT-EPI panel(s).	-1

The NHLBI ESP Exome Variant Project has not identified Arg115Cys in approximately 6,000 individuals of European or African American ethnicity, indicating that it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The amino acid substitution is non-conservative, as a positively charged Arginine residue is replaced by an uncharged Cysteine residue and the gain of a Cysteine may affect disulfide bond formation in the MECP2 protein. Arg115Cys alters a highly conserved position in the methyl CpG binding domain and other nearby missense mutations in this region of the domain have been reported in association with Rett syndrome. In addition, multiple in-silico algorithms predict Arg115Cys may be damaging to the structure/function of the protein.

It was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The R1004S variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is not conserved across species, and in silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic mutation or a rare benign variant. The variant is found in EPILEPSY panel(s).	-1

One sister shows severe Heart Failure. Yet another sister in her early thirties in this family passed away due to Sudden Cardiac Arrest; this sister was not sequenced. Their father is reported to have passed away in his forties of cardiac failure. Whole exome sequencing on these two sisters followed by interpretation of about 200 genes reported to cause cardiac malfunction yielded this variant as the prime candidate. The only other potentially interesting variants found were missense VUS''s in the TTN and LAMA4. This variant causes premature truncation of DSP after 713 amino acids instead of the usual 2871 amino acids. DSP connects desmin filaments to desmosomes, the rivets that hold neighboring cardiac muscle cells together. Truncating variants in one copy of DSP have been reported in a number of individuals with ARVD and DCM (PMID: 21606390,24503780). However, there are also several reports of one copy truncations without any clinical symptoms (PMID: 23137101). So truncations are possibly of limited penetrance. For all variants over all desmosomal genes, this penetrance is estimated to be 35% by age 40 and 60% lifelong. Heterozygous knockout mice models do show early death and heart disease (PMID: 16823493,22240500). DSP variants are typically associated with right ventricular disease, but left ventricular involvement with disease progress is common. There are also purely left ventricular instances reported (PMID: 16061754), due to a truncation at aa 586, which is close to the truncation in this case.

The NHLBI ESP Exome Variant Project has not identified Val782Ile in approximately 5,000 individuals of European or African American ethnicity, indicating that it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The amino acid substitution is conservative, as Valine and Isoleucine are uncharged, non-polar amino acids. Val782Ile alters a position in the UBE3A gene that is not conserved through evolution or in related proteins, and multiple in silico models predict it is likely not pathogenic. Therefore, the available evidence suggests that Val782Ile is likely non-pathogenic; however, the possibility that it is a disease-associated mutation cannot be excluded. The variant is found in INFANT-EPI panel(s).	0

In addition, this variant has been identified by our laboratory in 3 Caucasian adults with HCM and segregated with disease in 4 affected relatives across 2 families (LMM unpublished data). It has not been identified in large European American and African American populations by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS), which is consistent with a pathogenic role. The 3190+5G&gt;A variant is located in the 5' splice region and studies have shown that this variant results in skipping of exon 29 (Crehalet 2012), which is predicted to result in a truncated or absent protein. Splice variants and other truncating variants in MYBPC3 are established as pathogenic for HCM. In summary, the 3190+5G&gt;A variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM) based upon the absence in the general population, segregation with disease, and functional studies.	1

It has also been reported in 1 individual with CHD (Granados-Riveron 2010). Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. The variantÕs population frequency suggests that it is more likely benign but is too low to confidently rule out a disease-causing role. Additional information is needed to fully assess its clinical significance.	2

In addition, it has been identified by our laboratory in 1 individual with HCM and family history of SCD. The variant was absent from large population studies. Arganine (Arg) at position 1053 is highly conserved in evolution and the change to glutamine (Gln) was predicted to be pathogenic using a computational tool clinically validated by our laboratory. This tool's pathogenic prediction is estimated to be correct 94% of the time (Jordan 2011). In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM) based upon segregation studies and absence from controls.	0

This variant has been identified in 2 Caucasian probands out of &gt;1150 Caucasian probands (&gt;2300 chromosomes) tested by our laboratory. This low frequency increases the likelihood that this change is disease causing. In addition, threonine (Thr) at amino acid position 80 is highly conserved across several evolutionary distant species, increasing the likelihood that the change is pathogenic. Finally, this variant was predicted to be pathogenic using a novel computational tool (a customized sarcomere-specific PolyPhen tool, which was validated using a set of cardiomyopathy variants with well-established clinical significance). This tool's pathogenic prediction is estimated to be correct 94% of the time, which suggests but does not prove that this variant is pathogenic. Therefore, this variant is likely to be pathogenic.	0

In summary, the clinical significance of the Thr16555Ala variant is uncertain.	0

The K699T variant was not observed with any significant frequency in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. The K699T variant is a semi-conservative amino acid substitution, which may impact secondary protein structure as these residues differ in some properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is conserved in mammals; however, missense mutations have not been reported at nearby residues. In silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether this variant is a pathogenic mutation or a rare benign variant. The variant is found in CHILD-EPI panel(s).	0

The NHLBI ESP Exome Variant Project has not identified Leu855Phe in approximately 6,500 individuals of European or African American ethnicity, indicating that it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The amino acid substitution is conservative, as Leucine and Phenylalanine are both uncharged, non-polar amino acids. However, it alters a highly conserved position in the HECT domain of the protein where multiple other missense mutations have been reported in association with Angelman syndrome, and multiple in silico algorithms predict it may be damaging to protein structure/function. Variant was observed in two affected siblings. The variant is found in EPILEPSY panel(s).

It was not observed in approximately 6,500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Missense mutations in nearby residues (T228S and G237V) have been reported in association with Rett syndrome , supporting the functional importance of this region of the protein. However, the A234G variant is a conservative amino acid substitution, which is not likely to impact secondary protein structure as these residues share similar properties. This substitution occurs at a position that is not conserved across species, and Glycine is seen at this position in other mammals. In silico analysis is inconsistent in its predictions as to whether or not the variant is damaging to the protein structure/function. The variant is found in EPILEPSY panel(s).

According to a gene specific mutation database, it was identified in a female with atypical Rett syndrome and is classified as a variant of unknown significance. Pro976Leu was not observed in approximately 5,300 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. Although Proline and Leucine are both uncharged, non-polar amino acids, the loss of a bulky Proline residue may alter the secondary structure of the protein. However, it alters a poorly conserved position in the protein, and in silico analysis is inconsistent with regard to the effect this variant may have on the protein structure/function. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether Pro976Leu is a disease-causing mutation or a rare benign variant. The variant is found in EPILEPSY panel(s).

Furthermore, this variant did not segregate with disease in 3 affected relatives (LMM unpublished data, pers. comm.). This variant has also been identified in 0.1% (8/8338) European American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs200352299). In summary, the presence in different cardiomyopathies and frequency in the general population support that this variant is likely benign.	1

In addition, this variant has been identified by our laboratory in 3 individuals with various cardiomyopathies (1 with DCM and 2 with HCM). Three of the individuals with HCM described above also carried a pathogenic variant in the same gene (Van Driest 2004, Villacorta 2014, LMM unpublished data). This variant has also been identified in 7/8318 of European American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs201278114). Glycine (Gly) at position 5 is not conserved in mammals or evolutionarily distant species and the change to arginine (Arg) was predicted to be benign using a computational tool clinically validated by our laboratory. This tool's benign prediction is estimated to be correct 89% of the time (Jordan 2011). The presence of this variant in individuals with various cardiomyopathies (particularly HCM and DCM) reduces the likelihood that the variant is pathogenic as these cardiomyopathies have different cellular mechanisms of disease. In summary, while the clinical significance of the Gly5Arg variant is uncertain, collectively these data suggest that it is less likely to have a primary role in disease.	0

Additionally, this variant has been identified by our laboratory in 6 individuals (4 with DCM; 1 with HCM; 1 with early onset severe left ventricular dysfunction), though it did not segregate with disease in 1 of 3 affected individuals from 1 family. This amino acid is not well conserved in evolution which suggests a change at this amino acid may be tolerated. Collectively, these data support that the Arg1228Cys variant is less likely disease-causing, though additional studies are needed to fully assess its clinical significance.	0

In summary, there is insufficent data to determine the significance of the Val321Met variant at this time.	0

However, the variant has now been identified by our laboratory in 8 individuals (4 DCM, HCM) 4 of whom (1 DCM, 3 HCM) carried a second variant which could be responsible for disease. Because HCM and DCM are caused by different defects at the cellular level, it is currently believed that the same variant is unlikely to cause both cardiomyopathies. In addition, at least 3/8 probands are of minority races (2 Hispanic, 1 Asian, 3 unspecified, 2 white) suggesting this variant may be a benign variant more common to a racial subpopulation. In summary, the occurrence of the Arg160Trp variant in HCM as well as DCM probands, its frequent presence with additional variants, and identification in minority races argues against a highly penetrant pathogenic role.	1

Cell culture studies showed that the variant compromises TNNI3 function (Elliott 2000, Takahashi-Yanaga 2001). Our laboratory has detected the variant in 4 individuals with HCM (1 Caucasian adult, 2 Indian adolescents, and 1 Jordanian adolescent). In two of the non-Caucasian families (one Indian and one Jordanian), the inheritance was consistent with a recessive mode (3 affected individuals were homozygous from the 2 families and none of the heterozygous individuals were affected). In contrast, the previously reported individual with HCM (Kimura 1997), the Caucasian individual and one Indian individual tested by our laboratory were heterozygous, which is consistent with dominant inheritance. Although recessive inheritance has been described for the TNNI3 gene (Ala2Val; Murphy 2004), it is also possible that the Arg162Trp variant is common in Middle Eastern and/or Asian populations and therefore less likely to be disease-causing. At this time, we cannot rule out this possibility because control studies are not available for these populations. Arginine (Arg) at position 162 is conserved in mammals except two bat species, but not in evolutionarily distant species, raising the possibility that a change at this position may be tolerated or have a weaker effect. However, two other likely disease-causing variants have been identified at this position (Arg162Pro, Arg162Gln). In summary, it is possible that this variant is disease-causing, but has a milder effect in isolation (heterozygous) and results in HCM when seen with another variant(s) (homozygous or compound heterozygous). However, additional studies are required to further assess its clinical significance.	0

This variant was absent from large population studies. Studies have shown that the Tyr337Cys variant may impact protein function by increasing its activity though these results are inconclusive and these in vitro assays may not accurately represent biological function (Smith 2013). Due to the conflicting data about this variant, the clinical significance of the Tyr337Cys variant is uncertain.	0

In addition, this variant has also been identified by our laboratory in 2 isolated cases of HCM (1 adult and 1 infant). It has also been identified in 4 unaffected adult relatives from 2 families (JŠŠskelŠinen 2002, LMM unpublished data). This variant is a deletion of 1 lysine (Lys) residue at position 814 from a stretch of lysines and is not predicted to alter the protein reading-frame. It is unclear if this deletion will impact protein function. In summary, while there is some suspicion for a pathogenic role, the clinical significance of the Lys814del variant is uncertain.

This nonsense variant leads to a premature termination codon at position 875. This variant is located in the terminal exon, where nonsense mediated decay is unlikely, leading to a truncated protein lacking last 27 amino acids. One study reports a similar variant further upstream in the same exon that was shown to interfere with normal protein function (Asp859fsX4, Gehmlich 2011). On the other hand, a variant downstream (Ala897fs) is thought to be benign. In summary, is unclear whether this truncation will impact protein function and additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.

It has not been identified in large population studies. This nonsense variant creates a premature termination codon at position 500 and is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein. Functional and animal studies support the pathogenicity of the Arg500X variant (Riazuddin 2006, Nayak 2013). In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM).	0

It has been reported in 2 individuals with DCM and 1 individual with LVNC (Vatta 2002, Xi 2012). In vitro studies suggest that it may have functional consequences (Xi 2012), though it should be noted that in vitro studies may not accurately represent biological function and/or may not translate to disease. In summary, the frequency of this variant in the general population suggests that it does not cause disease on its own. It remains possible that it modifies disease expression.	4

One in vitro functional analysis study suggests the variant may impact normal intracellular trafficking of the protein (Rotman-Pikielny 2002). The p.Leu236Pro variant has been identified in 0.1% (9/8600) of European American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs80338848). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic (http://www.partners.org/personalizedmedicine/lmm).	0

The Cys72Trp variant has also been identified by our laboratory in 8 individuals with various cardiomyopathies (RCM, DCM, HCM and ventricular tachycardia) and in 1 affected relative. However, this variant has also been identified in 0.2% (15/8600) European American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs116840776) and 0.4% (13/3260) of published control chromosomes (McNally 1998, de Paula 2001, Vatta 2006, Arnestad 2007, Andreasen 2013). In vitro studies suggest that the Cys72Trp variant does not impact protein function (Cai 2009), though these types of assays may not accurately represent biological function. In summary, while the clinical significance of the Cys72Trp variant is uncertain, its population frequency and functional data suggest that it is more likely to be benign.	2

In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that the p.Val138Phe variant may impact protein function (Taylor 2002). This variant has been identified in 1/4406 African American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs111033199). Although this variant has been seen in the general population, its frequency is low enough to be consistent with a recessive carrier frequency.

The variant was compound heterozygous in at least 14 of those probands and was absent from large population studies. One study has shown that the Tyr530His variant impacts protein function (Choi 2009).

There is some controvesy over the clinical significance of this variant due to inconsistent functional studies (Alder 2008 vs Yang 2007, Yang 2009) and the fact that in most cases (9/10), no second mutation was identified. However, due to the absence of the variant in two control populations (0/452) despite a reasonably high frequency in probands (10/940) and one functional study supporting pathogenicity, we believe this variant is more likely pathogenic.	1

This variant was found to segregate with Pendred syndrome in two large families (Coucke 1999, Iwasaki 2006). In addition, is predicted to cause abnormal splicing because the nucleotide substitution occurs in the invariant region of the splice consensus sequence.

Five of these probands were homozygous or compound heterozygous. In one family, the variant segregated with disease across 7 meioses (Bolz 2001). The variant was absent from 590 control chromosomes. In addition, mRNA studies revealed that this variant affects splicing, causing in-frame skipping of 51 base pairs and subsequently leading to a loss of 17 amino acids of the protein (Becirovic 2008).

Although this information suggests a role for this variant, it is possible that the variant segregates with another variant that is causative for the hearing loss. Additional evidence, such as screening for this variant in a large ethnically-matched control population and functional studies, is needed to assume pathogenicity. Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, the clinical significance of the Glu216Val variant is uncertain.	2

While the reported proband had an alternate DNA change (c.35_36delinsTT), the predicted protein change is identical to that predicted for this patient. This Gly12Val variant is commonly seen as a somatic mutation in several cancers (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer, http://www.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic) and functional studies have shown it to dramatically alter cell growth (Aoki 2005).

In addition, another variant at the Ala146 residue (Ala146Thr) has also been identified as occurring de novo in one individual with mild clinical features of Costello syndrome (Zampino 2007). Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, MAPP, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, this variant is likely pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.	1

However, we suspect that the two reports were not independent and represent the same patient, who may also represent the present patient, based upon the co-occurrence of this variant and the Tyr16fs variant noted in one of the papers. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, the clinical significance of this variant cannot be determined with certainty at this time.	2

In addition, the variant segregated in 4 affected family members, and all affected individuals were reported to have hearing loss and normal electroretinograms (Ahmed 2003, Ahmed 2008). Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, this variant is likely to be pathogenic, though additional familial or functional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.	1

This mutation results in the gain of a Cysteine residue, which could interfere with disufide bonding, at a residue that is conserved across species. In silico analysis predicts this mutation is probably damaging to the protein structure/function. The Y666C mutation was not observed at any significant frequency in approximately 6,000 individuals of European and African American ancestry by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. We interpret Y666C as a disease-causing mutation. The variant is found in POMT2 panel(s).	0

This variant has been identified in 0.7% (57/8586) European American and 0.25% (11/4406) African American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs1800098). Computational prediction tools and evolutionary conservation analysis do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. However, in vivo studies suggest that the Gly576Ala variant may alter splicing of exon 13 (historically exon 12; Pagani 2003). In summary, the clinical significance of the Gly576Ala variant is uncertain.	2

This sequence change has been reported in affected patients in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/). However, the BIC database contains both benign and pathogenic sequence changes, and the interpretation of this particular sequence change is not necessarily informed by its presence in this database. This sequence change has been determined to have a very low probability of being pathogenic based on a multifactorial likelihood model; according to this study, this variant was observed in trans with a known pathogenic mutation (PMID: 17924331, 21990134). This sequence change is currently listed in ClinVar as Likely Benign (RCV000077359.2, Submitter: Sharing Clinical Reports Project); however, the evidence supporting this interpretation has not been made available. Based on the information currently available in the literature, our conclusion is that this variant is likely benign.

A different missense substitution at the same position, Ile72Asn, has also been identified in two unrelated females with atypical Rett syndrome (Evans et al., 2005; Pini et al., 2012). Ile72Thr alters a highly conserved residue in the catalytic domain of the protein. The variant is found in INFANT-EPI panel(s).	0

This sequence change has been shown to co-occur with two different BRCA2 and five different BRCA1 pathogenic sequence changes in the Universal Mutation Database (http://www.umd.be/BRCA2/4DACTION/Web_D_splice/7618). In an internal Invitae research study, this sequence change was also shown to co-occur with a pathogenic BRCA1 truncating variant. In vitro studies have demonstrated that this intronic change does affect mRNA splicing, resulting in a portion of BRCA2 mRNAs lacking exon 3 above the already 5% leaky altered splicing seen in wild-type samples (PMID: 20215541, 21939546). However, two studies disagree with this interpretation, and conclude that this sequence change has no effect on exon 3 splicing (PMID: 10534775, 21673748). Deletion of exon 3 is only pathogenic if exon 3 is completely removed in an allele - moderate to low levels of transcript with a deletion of exon 3 are neutral as long as the full-length transcript is present at a roughly normal level (PMID: 21939546). In light of this sequence change co-occuring with pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2sequence changes in multiple families, the population frequency and that a baseline partial loss of leaky altered splicing of exon 3 occurs in wild-type cells, this sequence change is likely benign.

This nonsense variant leads to a premature termination codon at position 90, which is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein. Heterozygous loss of function of the SDHB gene is an established disease mechanism in patients with paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. This variant has been identified in 1/2178 (0.05%) of chromosomes from a large, though clinically and racially unspecified population (dbSNP rs74315366), but has not been identified in other larger European American and African American populations by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS). The presence of this variant in the general population argues against pathogenicity, however it is possible that in diseases with clinical variability, reduced penetrance, or recessive inheritance, that pathogenic variants may be present at a low frequency in the general population. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic based on the loss of function nature of this variant and segregation data published in the literature (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM).	0

The Q367P mutation occurs in the linker region of CBL, which connects the RING finger domain and TKB domain, and is a region of the gene where germline and somatic mutations also have been described in hematological malignancies. Individuals with a germline mutation in the CBL gene may be at an increased risk of developing a hematologic malignancy, particularly juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) (Niemeyer et al., 2010;Perez et al., 2010). The Q367P mutation described in Martinelli et al. was found to be a de novo, germline mutation in a patient who was described as having many dysmorphic features suggestive of Noonan syndrome as well as an enlarged left atrium and transient chaotic ventricular dysrhythmias, but no hematologic malignancy (Martinelli et al., 2010). This variant has been observed in an individual with pleural effusion.	0

However, in none of the probands was a known pathogenic variant found on the second allele of GJB2. In addition, one of the 9 families demonstrated late-onset autosomal dominant inheritance, which is inconsistent with the autosomal recessive mode of inheritance in all other probands. In summary, the absence of second variants in all published probands and the presence of the variant in an autosomal dominant family suggests that this variant is more likely to be benign.	3

However, segregation was only tested in one of eight affected family members (Sun 2011), which is not enough to assume pathogenicity. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, additional data is needed to determine the clinical significance of this variant.	2

It was also absent from large population studies. Different disease-causing amino acid changes (Glu501Lys, Glu501Gly) at this location have been identified in &gt;10 affected individuals and both of these variants were reported to have occurred de novo in two individuals (Razzaque 2007,Narumi 2007, Niihori 2006, Rodriguez-Viciana 2006,Rodriguez-Viciana 2008, LMM unpublished data) suggesting that changes at this position are not tolerated. Additionally, computational prediction tools and evolutionary conservation analysis suggest that the Glu501Val variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, the Glu501Val variant is likely pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.

D22N is a non-conservative amino acid change as a negatively charged residue (Asp) is replaced by a neutral residue (Asn). The position at which this substitution occurs is conserved in the protein but not in related proteins. While the majority of missense variants in BRAF are pathogenic, no disease-causing mutation has been reported prior to codon 241.  D22N has been seen inherited from a clinically unaffected father.	1

It has also been identified by our laboratory in 9 individuals with HCM, but did not segregate with disease in 2 individuals from 2 families (LMM unpublished data). In vitro functional studies provide some evidence that this variant may impact protein function (Wolny 2013). However, in vitro assays may not accurately represent biological function. While this variant is rare in the general population (1/8598 European American chromosomes in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; rs141764279), it appears to be common amongst Ashkenazi Jewish individuals with a prevalence that greatly exceeds that of HCM (5/282 chromosomes, 1.8%; LMM unpublished data). In summary, the frequency of this variant in the Ashkenazi Jewish population and multiple occurrences of non-segregation with disease indicate this variant is likely benign, although a modifying effect cannot be ruled out.	2

It was absent from large population studies. This variant was predicted to be pathogenic using a computational tool clinically validated by our laboratory. This tool's pathogenic prediction is estimated to be correct 94% of the time (Jordan 2011). In summary, while there is some suspicion for a pathogenic role, the clinical significance of the Arg1712Gln variant is uncertain due to conflicting data.	1

Based on a multifactorial likelihood algorithm using genetic, in silico and statistical data, this sequence change has been determined to have a very low probability of being pathogenic (PMID: 17924331, 21990134). This variant has also been reported to co-occur with a pathogenic BRCA1 sequence change (PMID: 15235020), which supports a benign interpretation. This sequence change is currently listed in ClinVar as "Benign" (RCV000031124, Submitter: SCRP); however, the evidence supporting this interpretation has not been made available. Based on the information currently available in the literature, or conclusion is that this variant is Likely Benign.	1

This sequence change has been classified has as having high odds of being neutral on the basis of multiple parameters including co-occurrence with a deleterious mutation, family history, and segregation (PMID17924331, PMID21990134). Functional analysis showed that this sequence change is phenotypically indistinguishable from unaltered BRCA2 protein using multiple assays including sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, radiation-induced RAD51 foci formation, homologous recombination, and overall genomic instability (PMID19795481). This sequence change lies in exon 12 which is reported as functionally redundant and missense changes in this exon are likely to be neutral (PMID19795481).	0

This substitution affects a poorly conserved amino acid. Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, MutationTaster, AlignGVGD) suggest that this sequence change is likely to be tolerated, but these predictions have not been confirmed by functional studies. There is no evidence to indicate that this sequence change is pathogenic. It is possible that this sequence change represents a benign polymorphism in the BRCA2 gene, although at this time the evidence is insufficient to prove that conclusively.	1

This variant has not been reported in individuals with hearing loss or Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome, but also has not been identified in large population studies. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Ala287Glu variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, additional data is needed to determine the clinical significance of this variant.	-1

The amino acid substitution is non-conservative, as a positively charged Lysine residue is replaced by an uncharged Glutamine residue.  It alters a highly conserved catalytic residue in the ATP-binding site of the protein, which plays an important role in determining B-raf kinase activity (Fratev et al., 2009).  Additionally, multiple in silico models predict that K483Q is likely pathogenic.

This variant has not been identified in large population studies. In addition, another variant at the same residue (Lys483Asn) was identified as a de novo variant in an individual with features of a Noonan spectrum disorder (LMM unpublished data). Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Lys483Gln variant may impact the normal function of the protein. In summary, this variant is likely pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.	1

While congenital heart defects are a feature of Noonan syndrome, we do not know whether this proband had Noonan syndrome or an isolated heart defect. This variant has also been identified by our laboratory in one other proband who had clinical features associated with Noonan spectrum disorders. This residue is conserved across evolutionarily distinct species and computational analyses (PolyPhen2, SIFT, AlignGVGD) predict that this variant will impact the normal function of the protein. It should be noted that the sensitivity and specificity of these computational programs has not been determined by our laboratory. The clinical significance of this variant cannot be determined at this time; however based upon the arguments described above, we would lean towards a more likely pathogenic role.	0

In addition, several other amino acid changes at this position (Gly60Ala, Gly60Cys) have been observed in individuals with clinical features of Noonan syndrome, suggesting that changes to this residue are not tolerated. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic based on its de novo occurrence and that multiple variants affecting this codon are associated with features of Noonan syndrome (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM).	0

This variant has been reported to have occurred de novo in sporadic disease (Kratz 2005). It has also been identified in an individual with acute myeloid leukemia (AML, Tartaglia 2005). Additional amino acid changes at this position have also been associated with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia or Noonan syndrome with myeloproliferative disorders (Loh 2004, Kratz 2005). Therefore, this variant is highly likely to be pathogenic. The presence of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PTPN11 is consistent with a diagnosis of Noonan syndrome and Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia but this information should be reconciled with the complete clinical history of this individual.	0

The Phe71Leu variant has not been identified in large European American and African American populations by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/). This variant has also been identified as an acquired somatic mutation in patients with hematological malignancies (Tartaglia 2006, Tartaglia 2005, Loh 2004, Chan 2006). The majority of identified pathogenic variants in the PTPN11 gene are located in exon 3 and involve the amino acids preceding and following the Phe71 residue, affect the N-SH2 domain, and are gain-of-function/activating variants. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, this variant is likely pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.	1

However, the Ile309Val variant has also been identified in seven probands with clinical features of Noonan syndrome (Tartaglia 2002, Tartaglia 2006, Pergament 2011, Jongmans 2011, LMM unpublished data). However, two of these probands have an unaffected parent who carried the variant (Tartaglia 2002, LMM unpublished data). In addition, the three probands previously identified by our laboratory are of Ashkenazi-Jewish ancestry (LMM unpublished data). In summary, the Ile309Val variant is classified as likely benign based on its frequency in Ashkenazi-Jewish control chromosomes and presence in unaffected parents.	1

An additional variant at this position has been identified in 2 individuals with CFC by our laboratory (Lys601Thr), suggesting that changes to this amino acid position may not be tolerated. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, this variant is likely to be pathogenic.	1

Indirect and predictive evidence return conflicting suggestions regarding the impact of this sequence change on protein function. This substitution affects a moderately conserved amino acid. Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, AlignGVGD) suggest that this sequence change is likely to be tolerated, but these predictions have not been confirmed by functional studies. Algorithms developed to predict the effect of nucleotide changes on mRNA splicing predict that this sequence change may alter mRNA splicing, but this prediction has not been confirmed by functional studies. This sequence change is currently listed in ClinVar as Variant of unknown Significance (RCV000034387.1, Submitter: Biesecker Laboratory). The evidence at this time is insufficient to determine the clinical significance of this sequence change. As a result, it has been classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance.	0

Therefore this sequence change has been classified as likely benign. Early mutational analysis found this variant in lymphoma cases, and initial functional studies showed it to have transformative properties in vitro (PMID: 14559814). The observation that this variant occurs in the general population at the same frequency as that seen in cancer cohorts, combined with the inability to replicate the oncogenic properties of this variant in vitro, suggests that this sequence change is a rare polymorphism (PMID: 20670955).	1

It was also identified in 2 individuals with Fabry disease (Morais 2008, Turaca 2012). GLA activity in individuals carrying the variant was typically reduced but did not reach levels associated with classic Fabry disease. The variant was absent from &gt;1000 control chromosomes across these studies but was detected at low frequency (4/6728 chromosomes) in a broad European American population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs048158093). Our laboratory has identified the Arg118Cys variant an infant with RCM and skeletal myopathy, who also carried another variant of unknown significance and in a child with HCM, who carried another pathogenic variant. Arginine (Arg) at position 118 is not conserved in evolution (several mammals carry other amino acids), suggesting that a change at this position may be tolerated. On the other hand, computational tools (PolyPhen2, SIFT) suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, the available data raises the possibility that the Arg118Cys variant may lead to mild disease but is somewhat conflicting. Additional studies are needed to establish its clinical significance with confidence.

Studies have shown that the Pro205Thr variant impacts protein function and is responsive to drug treatments in cell lines (Shimotori 2008, Wu 2011). The mutant _-Gal A protein was shown to have 18% of the normal enzyme activity (Wu 2011). Of note, &gt; 1% _-Gal A activity has been associated with a cardiac variant of the Fabry phenotype in males (www.genetestw.org). However, these in vitro assays may not accurately represent biological function. In addition, drug treatment response was demonstrated during a clinical trial in a single individual with this variant (Wu 2011). In summary, this variant is likely to be pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.

The 3173-1G&gt;C variant is predicted to cause abnormal splicing because the nucleotide substitution occurs in the highly conserved splice consensus sequence. Computational splicing models predict this alteration to abolish the 3Õ acceptor splice site of intron 4 and result in both intron 4 retention and exon 5 skipping; however, the accuracy of these models is not known. Although this variant is consistent with a loss of function allele, additional family-based and functional studies are required to fully assess the impact of this variant. Together, the evidence suggests this variant is likely to be pathogenic.

In one individual, the Arg1331X variant was present in compound heterozygosity with a second variant and presented with early onset presentation of disease (Plaschke 2006). Studies have shown that this variant produces a shorter transcript and results in reduced MSH6 protein expression in patient samples (Plaschke 2006). Heterozygous loss of function variants in MSH6 have been associated with predisposition to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer and related cancers. In summary, this variant is likely pathogenic, though additional segregation and functional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.

Our laboratory has identified this variant in one proband where parental testing was performed and showed the variant occurred de novo (LMM unpublished data). This variant has also been identified as a somatic variant in individuals with hematologic malignancies including AML and ALL (Goemans 2005, Paulsson 2007). In addition, three other amino acid changes at this location (Ser502Thr, Ser502Pro, Ser502Ala) have been associated with the clinical features of Noonan syndrome and have also been identified as somatic variants in individuals with hematologic malignancies (Aoki 2008). The Ser502 residue is conserved across species and computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) suggest that the Ser502Leu variant may impact the normal function of the protein.

It has been seen in 10 probands referred for PTPN11 gene analysis. In two of these cases, his variant was inherited from an individual with no formal clinical evaluation. T553M is a non-conservative amino acid substitution in that a polar Threonine residue is replaced with a non-polar Methionine residue. The position at which this substitution occurs is only moderately conserved near the carboxyl terminus of the PTPN11 protein. As discussed at a recent international meeting per personal communication with Dr. Bruce Gelb (Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NY), the Noonan community now considers the T553M missense change to be a variant of unknown significance.	1

The E110K mutation lies within the highly conserved N-SH2 domain, which is the first of two sites involved in switching the protein between its inactive and active conformations. Another missense mutation at this position, E110A, has been reported previously in association with autosomal dominant Noonan syndrome (Zenker et al., 2004).	0

This variant was identified in that individual's mother; however clinical features for the mother were not provided. In addition, this variant has been detected by our laboratory in one Asian proband who also has a pathogenic MEK1 variant. The Lys131 residue is highly conserved across mammals and lower species and computational analyses (PolyPhen2, SIFT, AlignGVGD) suggest that the Lys131Arg variant may impact the normal function of PTPN11. Given this information, we are unable to make a conclusive determination as to whether this variant is responsible for the clinical features observed in this individual.

In addition, another nucleotide change (417G&gt;C) that results in the same amino acid change has also been reported in the literature in many individuals with the clinical features of Noonan syndrome, one individual with the clinical features of Noonan syndrome and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and one individual with Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (Ko 2008, Karow 2007, Tartaglia 2002, Chan 2006, Loh 2004, Bertola 2006, Hung 2007, Lo 2009). The 417G&gt;C variant has been reported to show both familial segregation and to have occurred de novo and is therefore highly likely to be pathogenic. Therefore, the 417G&gt;T variant is also highly likely to be pathogenic.

This variant been identified in 2/8588 European American and 2/4400 African American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs147422190). Functional data suggest that the Asp443Tyr variant may alter CFTR protein maturation (El-Seedy 2012), however this in vivo assay may not accurately reflect biological function. Computational prediction tools and evolutionary conservation analysis do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, the clinical significance of the Asp443Tyr variant is uncertain.	-1

It has been previously identified in 2 homozygous and 3 compound heterozygous individuals with cystic fibrosis and was found to segregate with disease in 1 family member (Dork 1993, Ramalho 2003, Wahab 2004, Ashavaid 2005, Nikolic 2013). It has not been identified in large population studies. This variant occurs in the invariant region (+/- 1,2) of the splice consensus sequence and is predicted to cause altered splicing leading to an abnormal or absent protein (Ramalho 2003). In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM) based upon segregation studies, absence from controls, and functional evidence.	-1

Electrophysiological studies have shown that the Arg222Gln variant impacts protein function (Mann 2012, Laurent 2012, Nair 2012, Cheng 2012). This variant has not been identified in large and broad European American and African American populations by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs45546039), which is consistent with a pathogenic role. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM) based upon segregation studies and absence from controls.	0

This sequence change involves a poorly conserved amino acid. Algorithms developed to predict the effect of missense changes on protein structure and function (SIFT, MutationTaster, AlignGVGD) suggest that this sequence change is likely to be tolerated, but these predictions have not been confirmed by functional studies. This sequence change has been reported in affected patients in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/). However, the BIC database contains both benign and pathogenic sequence changes, and the interpretation of this particular sequence change is not necessarily informed by its presence in this database. This sequence change is currently listed in ClinVar as Benign (SCV000054209, Submitter: SCRP); however, the evidence supporting this interpretation has not been made available. Based on the evidence available in the literature at this time, our conclusion is that the clinical significance of this variant is uncertain.	2

In addition, this variant is outside of the CBS domain (residues 277-555) where all pathogenic variants in PRKAG2 have so far been identified. In summary, the variants frequency in the general population suggests that is not disease causing in isolation though a modifying effect cannot be ruled out.	3

This variant has also been identified in 1/8344 European American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs199473335). Functional studies suggest this variant impact the protein (Ellinor 2008), though these in vitro studies may not accurately represent biological function. Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, additional data is needed to fully assess the clinical significance of the Asn1987Lys variant.	2

Therefore, this variant is not expected to cause highly penetrant, Mendelian disease. However, it was shown to increase the amount of MUC5B mRNA (Seibold 2013) and several studies have reported that one copy of the variant allele (T) increases the risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis 6-9 fold while two copies of the variant allele (T) increases the risk of developing pulmonary fibrosis 20-21 fold (Borie 2013; Hunninghake 2013; Peljto 2013; Seibold 2013; Stock 2013). In summary, this variant is considered a risk factor for pulmonary fibrosis. It is not expected to lead to disease on its own, but to act in conjunction with other genetic and/or environmental risk factors.	-1

This variant has also been identified by our laboratory in 1 child with DCM as well as 2 affected siblings (this individual's family). It has also been identified in 1/8348 European American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs371401403). Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis suggest that the Pro873His variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, while the available data on the Pro873His variant suggest it may play a disease-causing role, the clinical significance of this variant is uncertain.	2

The Arg668Cys variant has been identified in 0.8% (69/8600) European American and 0.3% (12/4406) African American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs1800100). Computational prediction tools and evolutionary conservation analysis suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity.

Note that two of these reports are conference abstracts only (Zafeirio 2005, Drouin 2004). Our laboratory has detected this variant in 4 individuals with a clinical diagnosis and family history of DCM +/- CSD as well as one affected family member. This variant is absent from large population studies. Computational prediction tools and conservation analysis suggest that this variant may impact the protein, though this information is not predictive enough to determine pathogenicity. In summary, although additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance, the Arg335Trp variant is likely pathogenic.	0

Our laboratory has previously identified this variant in two affected individuals (one with DCM, conduction system disease and skeletal myopathy and one with ventricular tachycardia) and was absent from 412 Caucasian and 354 Black control chromosomes (LMM unpublished data). Furthermore, arginine (Arg) at amino acid position 471 is conserved in evolutionarily distant species, suggesting that a change would not be tolerated. Finally, variants in LMNA have been identified in a range of disorders including dilated cardiomyopathy with or without conduction system disease, which is consistent with the features observed with this variant thus far. In summary, the data available so far suggests that the Arg471His variant is likely to be pathogenic.	0

Family history was unknown and the authors reported the substitution as a variant of unknown significance because in-silico algorithms were not consistent in their predictions of whether V481M was pathogenic. NHLBI Exome Variant Project has not identified V481M in approximately 6,000 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. The amino acid substitution is conservative as both Valine and Methionine are uncharged, non-polar amino acid residues. V481M alters a highly conserved position in the MECP2 protein. While several in-silico algorithms predict it may be damaging to the structure/function of the protein, one model predicts it may be benign. In addition, other missense variants at nearby codons (T479M, P480S) are classified as benign variants. Therefore, based on the currently available information, it is unclear whether V481M is a disease-causing mutation or a rare benign variant. The variant is found in INFANT-EPI panel(s).	1

It was not detected in more than 1000 control chromosomes (Taylor 2003, Lanktree 2007, Pasotti 2008). It is listed in dbSNP as a probable pathogenic variant (rs60890628) without additonal information. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, although the presence in affected individuals and absence in controls suggests that this variant may play a role in disease, it remains unclear if one variant could result in such a wide spectrum of phenotypes. Additional studies are needed to fully assess the clinical significance of the Ser573Leu variant.	2

Four of these patients had a very early age at onset (1 day, 2 mos, 2 mos, and 7 years) and no family history, which is atypical for LMNA variants. The Arg644Cys variant has also been identified in a large number of individuals (&gt;20) with a diverse range of clinical features consistent with laminopathy, isolated cardiomyopathy (DCM, ARVC, HCM) or Hallermann-Streiff syndrome, a rare genetic disorder with clinical overlap with some laminopathies (see references below*). In addition, one study reported non-segregation with disease in 2 families (Mercuri 2005). This variant has also been identified in 0.1% (9/8600) of European American and 0.1% (5/4406) of African American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; rs142000963). Computational prediction tools and conservation analyses do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein; however, in vitro functional studies indicate the variant may affect nuclear morphology (Csoka 2004). In summary, the lack of segregation with disease, its population frequency, and the wide-spectrum of associated phenotypes reduces the likelihood that the Arg644Cys variant can cause disease when present in isolation; however, a modifying effect when present with another variant or environmental factors remains possible.

Although this variant does not lead to an amino acid change, functional studies have shown that this variant induces the skipping of exon 51 leading to the in-frame deletion of 22 amino acids (Liu 1997). Therefore, this variant is likely to be pathogenic.	1

However, this variant has been identified by our laboratory in three individuals with some of the clinical features of Marfan syndrome, two of whom had another likely pathogenic variant in FBN1. Furthermore, this variant has been identified in 0.27% (19/7020) of European American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS, rs137854475). Although this data supports that the Arg1170His variant may be benign, additional studies are needed to fully assess its clinical significance.	2

In addition, this variant has been identified as a germline mutation in at least 14 unrelated individuals with NSCLC (including never smokers; Bell 2005, Prudkin 2009, Girard 2010, Tibaldi 2011, Oxnard 2012, Thomas 2013, Gazdar 2014, Yu 2014) and segregated with lung cancer and pulmonary disease in at least 4 affected individuals from 3 families (Bell 2005, Gazdar 2012, Yu 2014). This variant was absent from large population studies. While the literature reports strongly suggest that the p.Thr790Met variant can predispose to lung cancer, the penetrance of a germline p.Thr790Met variant has not been established and the functional impact of this variant in the germline is not well understood. In summary, this variant is likely to be pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.	1

In addition, this variant was absent from over 750 control chromosomes (Li 1997), supporting a pathogenic role. Furthermore, the Gln442X variant it leads to a premature stop at codon 442 and is predicted to lead to a truncated or absent protein. Loss of function is an established mechanism of disease for the ELN gene (Human Gene Mutation Database, HGMD). Therefore, the Gln442X variant meets our criteria for pathogenicity (http://pcpgm.partners.org/lmm) and is highly likely to be pathogenic.	0

The Arg49His variant has not been identified in large and broad European American and African American populations by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs121913006) and this low frequency supports a pathogenic role. A presence in other populations cannot be excluded. Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, conservation, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) do not provide strong support for or against an impact to the protein. In summary, the available evidence for this variant suggests that it is disease-causing, but additional information is still needed to establish this with confidence.	1

RNA studies demonstrated that the 1880-2A&gt;G abolishes the splice site, leading to the use of a cryptic splice site 38 bp downstream. The aberrantly spliced mRNA was shown to lack the first 38 bp of exon 13, which is predicted to cause a frameshift starting at position 627 and premature termination 19 amino acids later, leading to a truncated or absent protein (Pilichou, 2006). In summary, the severity of the change as well as absence from controls suggest that this variant is likely pathogenic.	1

However, it has been identified in 0.35% (29/8222) European American chromosomes from a broad population screened by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS; dbSNP rs121913013), strongly arguing against a disease causing role when present in isolation. There is some evidence that the Val56Met variant may predispose to dilated cardiomyopathy as Posch 2008 detected it in 13/538 DCM probands versus 3/617 control individuals (p&lt;0.007), but this study has not been replicated nor firmly established. In summary, the Val56Met variant is unlikely to be disease causing in isolation, but its increased frequency in patients with DCM versus healthy controls raises the possibility that it acts as a modifier when present together with other variants.	3

Homozygosity for this mutation is consistent with one of these disorders. The deletion causes a frameshift starting with codon Serine 727, changes this amino acid to an Alanine residue, and creates a premature Stop codon at position 3 of the new reading frame, denoted p.Ser727AlafsX3. This mutation is predicted to cause protein truncation and loss of normal protein function. The variant is found in POMT1 panel(s).	0

The variant has been shown to create a cryptic splice site and produce a 35-bp shorter transcript in lymphoblasts. This 35-bp deletion leads to a frameshift and premature termination codon 189 bases downstream. In summary, this variant meets our criteria to be classified as pathogenic.	0

This variant was absent from 220 Asian control chromosomes and 180 Caucasian control chromosomes (Ouyang 2002) but it is listed in dbSNP (rs41282932 - no frequency data). In summary, the presence of this variant in two individuals with another etiology for hearing loss and its presence in dbSNP suggests it is most likely benign.	3

This variant has been reported to affect protein function (Cook 1996) and may contribute to disease when homozygous or when present with other SERPINA1 variants (Ringenbach 2011). Computational analyses (biochemical amino acid properties, AlignGVGD, PolyPhen2, and SIFT) also support an impact to the protein though their accuracy is not known. In summary, additional information is needed to fully assess the clinical significance of this variant.	-1

It has been identified in 1.6% (140/8600) of European American chromosomes and in 0.4% (20/4406) of African American chromosomes by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/; dbSNP rs28929474). Individuals homozygous for the PI*Z allele have an appreciable risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema, and are also at an increased risk of developing liver disease. (American Thoracic Society 2003). The PI*Z allele rarely leads to AATD-related symptoms in heterozygous individuals (Stoller 2012). In summary, despite the high population frequency of the PI*Z allele, this variant meets our criteria for pathogenicity (http://pcpgm.partners.org/LMM).	-1

This variant was absent from large population studies but has been reported in at least 9 individuals with ARVC, two of whom carried other ARVC variants and presented with early onset disease (Den Haan 2009, Barahona Dussault 2009, Xu 2010, Quarta 2011, Baskin 2013). It was also identified in 1 asymptomatic teenager and 1 elderly individual with PVCs (Perrin 2013). Our laboratory has detected this nonsense variant in 3 individuals with ARVC and 2 affected relatives. In summary, this variant is likely to be pathogenic, though additional studies are required to fully establish its clinical significance.	1

However, several recent studies identified this variant in 0.2%-0.8% of healthy control chromosomes (Christensen 2010: 3/1300; Fressart 2010: 3/600; Barahona-Dussault 2010: 0.08%), and this variant has been identified in 0.5% (35/7020) of European American chromosomes from a broad population by the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project (http://evs.gs.washington.edu/EVS/). In summary, we cannot rule out that this variant modifies disease severity, but believe that it is unlikely disease causing when present in isolation.	0

This mutation is often observed in females with the preserved speech variant of Rett syndrome and has also been identified in females with classic and atypical Rett syndrome (Leonard et al., 2003; Neul et al., 2008; Bebbington et al., 2008). R133C alters a highly conserved position in the methyl-binding domain of the protein, and functional studies indicated that it impairs binding to methylated DNA (Yusufzai et al., 2000; Galvao et al., 2005). The variant is found in EPILEPSY,INFANT-EPI,RETT-EPI panel(s).	0

This variant alters a highly conserved residue in the methyl-binding domain of the protein. Multiple studies indicate that Thr158Met impairs normal protein function (Kudo et al., 2003; Agarwal et al., 2011), and it appears to be associated with a more severe clinical presentation when scored on the Kerr scale (Bebbington et al., 2008).

The R270X mutation is predicted to cause loss of normal protein function through protein truncation. This mutation was not observed in approximately 6500 individuals of European and African American ancestry in the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project, indicating it is not a common benign variant in these populations. This variant has been observed de novo without parental validation. The variant is found in EPILEPSY panel(s).	0
